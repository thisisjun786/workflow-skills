# Plugin packaging

This repository publishes its skills as a versioned Codex plugin. The package also
declares the task-bridge MCP server and the completion Stop hook, and ships the two
small launchers that start them. It carries no runtime: the bridge, the session
relay, the Python environment and the completion adapter keep their own installer,
and the launchers only point at what that installer left behind.

## What the package is

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | Marketplace entry; its `source.path` names the plugin root |
| `plugins/crw/` | The plugin root, copied into the version cache as it stands |
| `plugins/crw/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | Manifest: plugin name, version, and the declared skills path |
| `plugins/crw/skills/` | The seven skills, one of the two declared components |
| `plugins/crw/wiring/` | The declared Stop hook and MCP server, and the two launchers they start |
| `plugins/crw/LICENSE` | The repository license, shipped with the package |
| `skills` | A link to `plugins/crw/skills`, kept for installations made before the move |

Edit the skills at `plugins/crw/skills/`; the root `skills` link is a compatibility
path, not a second copy, and it is a Git symlink, so a checkout without symlink
support turns it into a plain text file. The supported platform is Linux x86_64.

What may sit in the plugin root is whatever the manifest declares, plus
`.codex-plugin/` and `LICENSE`. Installation copies that directory verbatim,
including untracked and ignored files, so anything left there is published, and a
component nobody declared installs without ever loading. `python3 scripts/ci/plugin.py`
derives the permitted roots from the manifest, refuses a declaration naming a file the
package does not ship, and checks the hook and server documents against the shapes that
were measured to load. The manifest itself may carry only the keys
the ingestion validator knows, and optional presentation fields are checked against
its shapes: URLs that begin with `https://`, a `#RRGGBB` brand colour, and `./`
relative asset paths the package actually ships.

The manifest declares every component the package ships. A declared component replaces
default discovery rather than adding to it, measured on codex-cli 0.154.0: a plugin declaring a
non-default skills directory while also holding `./skills/` loaded only the declared
one. The plugin specification bundled with Codex describes the opposite, saying
declared components supplement default discovery. This package follows the measured
behavior and keeps every shipped component under a declared path.

## How hooks and MCP servers load

Measured on codex-cli 0.154.0 by installing probe plugins into isolated Codex homes and
ending real turns against a local stub model provider, so the readings below are what a
hook and a server actually did rather than what an installer accepted. The evidence is
kept with the task record, outside this repository.

| Reading | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `hooks` as an array of file paths | Loads, and the hooks fire |
| `hooks` as one string path | Loads, and the hook fires |
| `hooks` as an inline document | Does not load |
| No `hooks` key, with a `./hooks/` directory present | Does not load: there is no default discovery for hooks |
| Firing without persisted hook trust | Nothing fires. `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` is what made a probe fire |
| `[hooks.state]` after installing, after read-only commands, after a session | Empty every time; `codex exec` never recorded trust |
| Variables in a hook command | Expanded: the command goes through a shell and the process carries `CODEX_HOME`, `PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` |
| The same variables for a hook registered in `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` | `PLUGIN_ROOT` is absent; that environment belongs to plugin-declared hooks |
| `skills`, `hooks` and `mcpServers` declared together | All three load |
| A relative command in an MCP declaration | Resolves only when `cwd` is set; a `cwd` of `.` resolves to the installed version directory |
| An MCP declaration with no `cwd` | `cwd` stays null and the server never starts |
| A plugin-root variable in an MCP argument | Delivered literally, never expanded, and the server never starts |
| What an MCP server inherits | `HOME` and its working directory. Not `CODEX_HOME`, not `PLUGIN_ROOT` |

Those two environments are opposites, and the wiring is built around the difference. A
hook command can name the plugin root and the Codex home through shell variables because
a shell expands them. An MCP command can do neither, so it sets `cwd` to `.` with a
`./` relative argument, and the program it starts derives the Codex home from its own
location: the cache layout is
`$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>`.

Hooks ship as an array with one event per file. A single file carrying several events
works too, but a hook's identity is positional, so adding an event to a shared file
renumbers the ones after it and detaches the trust Codex recorded against them.

Installing the package does not make its hooks run. Trust is a separate, explicit step,
and until it is given the declared hooks are inert. That is why installation activates
nothing on its own, and why the installation flow has to say so rather than leave an
operator waiting for a hook that is working exactly as installed.

## Install

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add thisisjun786/codex-relay-workflow --ref dev
codex plugin add crw@crw
```

For development, register a local checkout as its own marketplace so it stays
separate from the published one:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/codex-relay-workflow
codex plugin add crw@crw
```

Installing creates no credential. The marketplace entry sets
`authentication: ON_USE`, so Linear and repository access are checked when a skill
needs them, and a skill says so and stops when they are missing.

## Turning the wired surfaces on

Installing the package installs the skills, and registers nothing else that works on
its own. The declared MCP server and Stop hook both reach a runtime this package does
not carry, and each needs a step the installation cannot take for you.

1. Install the runtime, if this host has none:
   `python3 scripts/runtime_install.py install --dest <destination> --apply`.
2. Write the two records the launchers read. Neither registers anything itself:
   `python3 scripts/runtime_install.py register-mcp --owner plugin --bridge-command <destination>/current/bin/codex-thread-bridge --apply`
   and
   `python3 scripts/runtime_install.py hook --adapter completion --owner plugin --dest <destination> --apply`.
   Each refuses when the same surface is already registered the other way, because the
   two together would run two bridges, or two hooks on every Stop.
3. Trust the hook. Until it is trusted nothing fires, and no command in this repository
   grants that: installing writes no trust, and a session without it runs the hook zero
   times and says so nowhere.

Step 3 is what makes an installed hook look broken while it is working exactly as
installed. Steps 1 and 2 may run in either order; step 3 is last, because it is trust in
the hook as it then stands.

None of this starts a daemon. The server is a stdio process Codex spawns per session,
the hook runs on a Stop and exits, and the completion hook installs in `observe` mode,
which classifies and records and never holds a turn.

The linked installation in [README](../README.md#install) still works and is
unchanged. Both installations read the same source: `scripts/install.py` links the
directory the manifest declares, and the repository root keeps `skills` as a link
to it so links created before the move still resolve.

A host carrying both runs two of everything. [Moving a manual install to the plugin
install](plugin-transition.md) is how one becomes the other, and it owns the update, the failed
update, the disable and the removal that follow.

## Skill names

A linked installation exposes the skills as `crw-run`, `crw-plan`, and so on. A
plugin installation namespaces them under the plugin name, so the same skills are
offered as `crw:crw-run`, `crw:crw-plan`, and so on. The documents keep the
unprefixed names and the mapping lives in
[the shared integration guide](../plugins/crw/skills/crw-plan/references/integrations.md),
so one revision reads correctly under either installation.

`scripts/ci/plugin.py` derives the namespaced names from the revision rather than
from a list in prose:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci/plugin.py --json
```

Whether a client resolves a `$`-prefixed invocation token for a plugin skill, and
whether the per-skill `agents/openai.yaml` interface metadata is read under a
plugin installation, were not measured for this change.

## Adding a skill

Create the directory under `plugins/crw/skills/` with its `SKILL.md` and
`agents/openai.yaml`. The manifest lists no skills: the package ships whatever the
declared path holds at the release revision, and `scripts/ci/plugin.py` derives the
namespaced names from that revision, so a skill developed in parallel is included
once its commit is part of that revision. The installer test pins the current seven
names as a positive control, so a new skill belongs in that list too. Keep relative
links between skills pointing at siblings under the same parent; the cache preserves
that layout.

Bump `version` in the manifest when the change should reach installations, and
install the plugin again: a cached version changes only on installation, and a task
already running keeps the package its session started with.


## Update and roll back

The cache keeps one version per plugin, and installing a new version replaces the
previous directory instead of keeping both. Rolling back therefore means making
the source offer the earlier revision again and reinstalling it, not selecting an
older copy from the cache. Bump `version` in the manifest for a release; a new
task picks up the new package when its session starts, and work already running
keeps the version it started with.

Removing the plugin deletes the cached version directory and the plugin entry in
`config.toml`. It leaves the marketplace registration, so removing that is a
separate step, and it does not touch the relay store, the bridge ledger, the hook
journal or the runtime installation.

## Verify

Structural checks run offline and are part of CI:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci/plugin.py            # package shape, hygiene, release digest
python3 scripts/ci/validate.py          # skill metadata, local links, Python syntax
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/ci/tests
```

`plugin.py` builds the release payload from a Git revision rather than from the
working tree, so the bytes it validates are the ones a clone publishes. `--json`
prints that payload digest, and `--payload <dir>` applies the same rules to an
installed cache directory, which is how an installed tree is compared against its
source.

A passing check is evidence about this source. It is not evidence that a plugin
installed, that a skill loaded on any host, or that a running workflow changed.
Those need their own observation of `codex plugin list`, `codex debug prompt-input`
and the behavior itself.
