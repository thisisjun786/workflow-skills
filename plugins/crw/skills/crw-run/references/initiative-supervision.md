# Initiative supervision

Run executes the scope its task is bound to. Where that scope is an initiative, this file is the
entry: how a task becomes that initiative's supervisor, which projects it is executing, when it is
finished, what each parent receives, what comes back, and how it recovers. The roles themselves are
the shared [supervisor, parent and child scope](../../crw-plan/references/integrations.md#supervisor-parent-and-child-scope),
and the project-level procedures [crw-run](../SKILL.md) already owns are not repeated here one
level up.

Nothing here is a transport. It establishes no automatic resume, no supervisor host goal, no
registration a runtime performs and no wake-up.
[OPS-7.4](operations.md#ops-74-three-levels-and-their-routing-identity) records that the bundled
relay holds no supervisor relationship, so every sentence below about a recorded relationship is
conditional on an installation that has one, and an instruction a reader follows is not a store
that enforces it.

## One request in four starts a supervision

An initiative turns up in requests that want quite different things, and the difference is in the
request rather than in the link.

| Request | Owner | Effect on binding |
|---|---|---|
| Execute this initiative's agreed projects, naming the initiative | this entry, through [crw-run](../SKILL.md) | designates this task as that initiative's supervisor |
| Define or plan it | [crw-define](../../crw-define/SKILL.md), [crw-plan](../../crw-plan/SKILL.md) | none; planning creates no supervisor and moves no ownership |
| How is it going | a status read | none; it reads existing records and wakes nothing |
| An initiative link carried as context by other work | the operation already running | none; it locates context |

A designation is explicit and names the initiative. A link by itself rebinds no existing parent,
and a title, a folder, a branch or a chat link makes no role at all: identity stays on the stable
IDs under [OPS-7.1](operations.md#ops-71-what-an-assignment-binds). Explicit read-only,
status-only, plan-only, no-create, no-goal and narrower delivery limits survive this routing
exactly as they survive it in Run, and they travel down without widening
([OPS-7.3](operations.md#ops-73-isolation-between-parents)).

## What the binding fixes

Bind three things together, because a supervision missing any of them has no boundary:

- the stable initiative ID and URL, with the revision of the body the finish condition was read from;
- the approved project set, each project by stable ID; and
- the completion boundary, which is that finish condition as the initiative states it, together
  with what the designation excludes.

Membership comes from the designation itself. Where it enumerates projects, that list is the set.
Where it names only the initiative, the set is the initiative's contributing projects at the
revision read, written out project by project in the record, so a later reader compares against a
list that was fixed rather than against a relation that has moved since.

The approved set is the set agreed at designation. A project created or linked to the initiative
afterwards is outside it, and admitting one is a scope change recorded with its source and date,
for the same reason a project link does not approve future backlog additions one level down.
Executing an initiative is therefore never a standing claim on whatever the initiative later
accumulates, and it reaches no work outside it.

Where a project in the set already answers to a different initiative's execution supervisor, it
keeps that one: this initiative references its outcome instead of issuing it work, and the
reference is recorded as a reference so nobody later reads it as an instruction. A supervisor
binding makes this task no project's parent and no issue's child, it holds no checkout, and it
merges nothing ([OPS-9.3](operations.md#ops-93-the-parent-merges-and-does-not-release)). Where an
installation records these relationships, one live scope per task per role is the rule it enforces,
so a second same-role binding is refused rather than silently replacing the first. Where nothing
records them, and the bundled relay records none, the reuse below is a read and not a lock: two
designations issued at once can both find no supervisor, and the initiative's own record is what
reconciles that afterwards rather than what prevents it.

The record is the initiative's own, written by the supervisor under the
[initiative body standard](../../crw-plan/references/integrations.md#initiative-body-standard) and
its comments and updates. The supervision record that makes recovery possible is in
[Coordination record](task-packet.md#coordination-record).

## Reuse before creating anything

Read in this order and stop at the first level that already exists, because every later step
assumes the earlier one was checked:

1. **The supervisor.** If this initiative already has one, that task is the supervisor. Read its
   record and status without waking it, and continue there rather than binding a second.
2. **Each project's parent.** A project in the set with a parent keeps it. Read that parent's
   coordination record for its issue scope, delivery limits and current state.
3. **Each parent's children.** A live child is the owner of its issue. It is not reassigned, not
   duplicated and not addressed by this task.
4. **The pull requests already open.** Each issue's one current delivery pull request is in its
   parent's record; read it there rather than asking for a new one or opening a second.

Repeating the designation, and resuming after an interruption, run this same order and converge on
the same tasks. Reuse is the first move and creation is what remains after it, so a supervision
that starts twice does not produce two of anything. A busy parent, an unreachable record or an
uncertain read is not evidence that a level is missing; it is a level that has not been read yet.

## Hand a project to its parent

What travels down is one project's brief and nothing below it: the project's criteria and the
revision they were read at, its prerequisites including the peers it shares a surface with, the
authority and limits in force, and the current state as locators rather than contents. The shape is
[Project handoff](task-packet.md#project-handoff), written in English like every instruction
between tasks.

Two carriers, chosen by whether the parent exists. A project with no parent gets the handoff as the
first prompt of the new task, prefixed with the project designation so that task runs its own
[Project parent binding](../../crw-plan/references/integrations.md#project-parent-binding). An
existing parent gets it as a [Coordination message](task-packet.md#coordination-message) of kind
project handoff, carrying the [restoration block](task-packet.md#restoration-block) whether that
parent is running or idle.

A handoff sent is not a parent bound. The transport accepting it, the parent binding the project,
and the parent returning a result are three facts recorded separately, and the first does not
establish the second.

From there the project is the parent's. It decides the issues, their dependencies and order, which
children exist, and how each delivery is verified and integrated. The supervisor does not repeat
that investigation, write those issue bodies or review those diffs, because running the same
enquiry once per level is how one project's cost becomes three. Nor does it instruct a child: a
change it wants in a child's work is said to that child's parent.

Preparation is per project and never a queue. A project whose brief is ready is handed over now,
while another is still being prepared, and a project whose prerequisites are met does not wait on
an unrelated one. Holding a ready project needs a concrete reason recorded against it: a
prerequisite not yet verified, a shared resource whose order is still being decided, or a limit the
designation imposes.

## What travels back up

A parent returns four things and no more: the project's result, the evidence per criterion, the
problems it could not resolve, and the decisions it needs. Everything else stays where it already
is. The child's per-finding trail stays on its pull request, the parent's issue records stay in the
project, and the raw receipts stay in their private evidence locations; the report carries the
pointer to each.

Real delivery facts are read through the relationships that already hold them rather than recopied
upward. Which pull request delivers an issue, which revision a verdict was recorded against and
whether a merge actually landed are already recorded by the parent and, where an installation holds
the assignment, by that record; the supervisor reads them there and treats
[Implementation Done](../../crw-plan/references/integrations.md#implementation-done) as the test for
a landing. A green check, a parent's acceptance and a completed turn are not that evidence.

The supervisor decides what a pair of parents cannot settle alone: a disagreement, a change that
widens either project's scope, who owns newly discovered work, and shared resources including the
order in which projects reach a shared target. It verifies each reported project outcome against
the initiative's finish condition and stops there. Child delivery, parent acceptance, the merge,
installation, observed behaviour, project completion and initiative completion stay separate
claims, so a few projects marked done do not finish the initiative.

## Recover the supervision

After a compaction, a turn ending or a restart, read the supervision record first, then refresh
only what can have moved: each parent's status and its last returned result, the state of the
requests still outstanding, and the current head and checks of the pull requests already named.
The investigation, the plan and the issue bodies are not regenerated; they are in Linear and in
each parent's record, and rewriting them from this task's view replaces those records with a guess.

A child that is alive keeps its issue. Uncertain delivery, an unreadable record or an elapsed wait
is not proof that a writer is gone, and recovery that cannot read a level reports that level as
unknown rather than treating it as empty. Reconcile before creating, never after.

## Cases

These are the situations this entry has to get right. Three of them are already worked one level
down in the [operations scenarios](operations/scenarios.md) as S29, S30 and S31, and are cited
rather than rewritten.

### C1 Several projects, ready at different times

Observed: the approved set holds four projects. Two have verified prerequisites, one waits on a
contract another project is still delivering, and one has no parent yet.
Clauses: [OPS-7.1](operations.md#ops-71-what-an-assignment-binds),
[OPS-7.3](operations.md#ops-73-isolation-between-parents).
Action: hand the two ready projects to their parents now, and create the missing parent for the
third as its brief is finished, rather than preparing all four and starting together. Record
against the waiting project the exact prerequisite and where its verification will appear.
Preserved: no project is delayed by another project's preparation, and the waiting one is held by a
recorded dependency rather than by a queue.

### C2 A project that contributes to several initiatives

Observed: a project in the approved set is also linked to another initiative, which has its own
execution supervisor.
Clauses: [OPS-7.3](operations.md#ops-73-isolation-between-parents),
[OPS-7.4](operations.md#ops-74-three-levels-and-their-routing-identity); worked as S29.
Action: leave its execution supervisor and its parent as they are, reference its outcome, and
record the reference as a reference. Do not instruct that parent, clone its children or count its
delivery twice. A requirement for that project goes to its own supervisor, which decides it.
Preserved: one execution owner per scope, and no second supervisor reaching into a bound parent.

### C3 The existing parent is busy

Observed: the project's parent exists and its turn is running.
Clauses: [OPS-7.3](operations.md#ops-73-isolation-between-parents).
Action: read its state and steer the verified active turn with the handoff, rather than waiting for
idle or creating a second parent. A transport that refuses a message to an active task is
protecting that turn. If the turn changes between reading and sending, read again and reclassify
instead of retrying blind.
Preserved: one parent per project, its running work intact, and no duplicate writer.

### C4 The existing parent is idle

Observed: the project's parent exists, has no running turn, and its last result is older than the
current project state.
Clauses: [OPS-7.1](operations.md#ops-71-what-an-assignment-binds).
Action: send the handoff by the ordinary message path with the restoration block, because an idle
task has usually lost the context its first prompt gave it. Refresh the brief to the current
revision before sending rather than resending the original.
Preserved: the same parent, the same binding, and a brief that matches what is true now.

### C5 The binding cannot be settled

Observed: two candidates match by name, or a record names a supervisor whose task cannot be
confirmed, or the designation does not resolve to one initiative.
Clauses: [OPS-7.1](operations.md#ops-71-what-an-assignment-binds),
[OPS-7.2](operations.md#ops-72-never-route-on-a-display-name-or-a-working-directory); the
ownership half is worked as S30.
Action: bind nothing. Report the exact ambiguity with its candidates and what would settle it, and
ask. Meanwhile continue any part of the work whose ownership is not ambiguous. Never pick by title,
by folder or by whichever record was read last.
Preserved: no supervision created on a guess, and no existing parent rebound by accident.

### C6 Read-only or report-only scope

Observed: the request names the initiative, and the scope forbids sending work, writing records or
both.
Clauses: [OPS-7.3](operations.md#ops-73-isolation-between-parents); worked as S31.
Action: resolve the binding, read the projects and their parents, and return the brief each parent
would receive, the reuse order and the gaps, without sending a handoff, creating a task or writing
a record. Name the one missing permission rather than substituting a narrower action and calling
it done.
Preserved: the limit, and a result the user can act on without repeating the investigation.

### C7 No-create scope where parents already exist

Observed: the designation authorizes execution but forbids creating tasks, and some projects
already have parents while others do not.
Clauses: [OPS-7.3](operations.md#ops-73-isolation-between-parents).
Action: hand each existing parent its project and keep going through it. No-create removes
creation authority, not the execution the designation already carries, and reusing a verified
existing owner is what the project level does already when a creation path is unavailable. Report
only the projects that would need a parent created, naming that one missing permission.
Preserved: the creation limit, and every project whose owner already exists still moving rather
than collapsed into a report nobody asked for.

### C8 Part of the set is already finished

Observed: two projects in the approved set are complete, with their pull requests merged and their
outcomes verified.
Clauses: [OPS-7.1](operations.md#ops-71-what-an-assignment-binds); landing evidence per
[Implementation Done](../../crw-plan/references/integrations.md#implementation-done).
Action: record the verified outcome and its evidence pointer, and execute only what remains. Do not
reopen a finished project, re-verify a landing already verified at the same revision, or hand its
parent a brief it has already delivered. Completing the initiative still needs its finish condition
to hold on those outcomes together.
Preserved: finished work stays finished, and the initiative is not reported complete because some
of its parts are.
