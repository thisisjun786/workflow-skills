"""The Stop hook the CRW plugin package declares, and the least it can possibly do.

The package cannot carry a Python runtime: the version cache is replaced wholesale on every
install, so an executable a running process depends on must live outside it. What ships here
instead is the indirection. This file finds the settings the runtime installer wrote, checks
that the plugin is the owner of this registration, and hands the host's payload to the adapter
those settings name.

It inherits the adapter's three refusals, because a hook that breaks them costs turns rather
than reporting a fault.

It parses no arguments. The host reads exit 2 as the blocking code and argparse exits 2 on any
usage error, so there is no argument parser here and nothing imported that has one.

It writes nothing to stderr and exits 0 on every path, including the paths where it does
nothing at all. An unreliable detector must degrade into no detector, never into a stuck
session.

It decides nothing. The only bytes that can reach stdout are the ones the adapter produced.

And one rule of its own. A host can hold both registrations at once -- an installed plugin
declaring this hook and a hook file entry the runtime installer appended -- because installing
the plugin is not a command this repository runs and cannot be refused from here. Both would
fire on the same Stop. So this launcher stands down unless the settings name the plugin as the
owner, which makes the guarantee hold at run time as well as at install time.

    A plugin-declared hook command runs through a shell and its process carries CODEX_HOME, so

    What this deliberately does NOT read is the settings override the rest of this repository
    honours. A plugin declaration carries no settings argument, so nothing ties the environment
    an install ran under to the environment a session starts under, and those are two different
    environments: refusing the override at installation only settles the first one. A session
    that inherits the variable from a shell profile or a legacy user-owned setup would be sent
    somewhere the installer never wrote, and a Stop that cannot find its settings releases in
    silence -- the failure that looks exactly like nothing happening.

    So the install refuses an override and this reads one path. Together those make the
    location an invariant instead of a value two sides have to agree about.
