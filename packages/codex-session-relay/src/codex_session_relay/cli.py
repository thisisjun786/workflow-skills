    Read from the authorized settings the creation result reported, because that is what a
    send actually sends. A policy file on disk may describe something else entirely, and the
    question here is what this installation would really do, not what it is configured to do.

    Normalised through the same helper delivery uses rather than read raw, for that same
    reason. An authorized policy may legitimately omit a documented default -
    `{"type": "workspaceWrite"}` passes `TaskSettings.require_usable()` - and the adapter then
    applies `networkAccess: false`, empty writable roots and the two temporary-directory
    flags. A receipt built from the raw JSON would report `networkAccess` as null for a
    participant whose sends really do carry false, which is the opposite of what this field
    exists to answer.

    Total, like the helper it leans on. These rows can hold anything an older writer or a hand
    edit left behind, and this is a diagnosis: one unreadable participant must cost that
    participant's line, never the store identity and access evidence standing beside it.

    Readable is not the same as deliverable, and the difference is the whole point of the
    field. A row can parse, normalise and still be refused before its settings ever reach a
    host, in which case no sandbox goes on the wire at all - and reporting it as what the
    adapter would carry tells an operator access is fine for a participant whose sends are
    never made. So the recorded values are still shown, because they are the only clue to WHY
    delivery refuses this participant, and `deliverable` says whether a send can carry them.

    The set is the constraints delivery imposes on the RECORDED row before turn/start, and it
    has two kinds of member. A TRANSFORMATION can fail on the row by raising, so it is RUN
    here rather than described: `TaskSettings.require_usable()` in
    `DeliveryService._settings_for` (delivery.py), the resume-params construction in
    `_guarded_send` (bridge_adapter.py), and `normalise_environments`, which is the one the
    first two do not already reach. A VALUE CONSTRAINT cannot fail by raising: it exists only
    as a comparison against a fixed value in the resume verification, so the recorded value is
    compared against that same value instead.

    The two are reported in different fields because they decide different things. A failing
    transformation settles the send on the row alone - no host can consume
    `runtimeWorkspaceRoots: 7` - so it makes `deliverable` false. A violated value constraint
    settles only what a host that reports the setting BACK will do, and a host that replaces
    it proceeds, so it lands in `refusedIfPreserved` and leaves `deliverable` describing the
    preparation. Collapsing them cost a round in the other direction: the receipt denied a
    send that today's delivery completes when the host normalises the value.

    Five versions of this field were wrong the same way before those two sentences could be
    written: each named the answer after the members it had been shown - the sandbox type,
    then `require_usable()`, then the params construction, then the post-response half, then
    the constraint that raises nothing at all. The set is not kept by hand here.
    `test_every_transformation_a_send_applies_to_the_record_is_covered` (tests/test_cli.py)
    derives both kinds from those two modules and fails if a member of either is added that
    this does not reach.

    What it does NOT answer is whether the host accepts the parameters. The App Server's own
    schema is not in this repository, so nothing here can say what it does with a recorded
    `cwd: 7`: the params are built and sent, and the answer comes back from the wire.
    `deliverable` is about the constraints delivery imposes on the row, and typing the
    recorded fields locally would belong in `require_usable()` beside the policy rule.

    """One participant's observed answer to: which store is this, and may I use it?

    Every field is measured rather than declared. The identity and the device/inode pair come
    from the probe's own stat; the read and write answers come from a real read-only
    connection and a real rolled-back write transaction, not from a permission bit; and the
    sandbox comes from the settings the adapter would carry rather than from configuration.

    It exists to be COMPARED. Two participants put their receipts side by side to find out
    whether they are on one database or two, and a matching path does not settle that: two
    spellings can be one file, and one spelling can be two files on different mounts or in
    different sandboxes. The device and inode are what actually answer it, which is why they
    are here beside the path rather than instead of it.

    The pair is decisive in one direction only, and `compare_store` (store.py) grades it that
    way. A DIFFERENT pair means a different file; an agreeing pair is not sufficient for the
    same one. It is namespace-local, so participants in separate mount namespaces or on
    different hosts can hold one pair while sharing nothing, and one inode can be reached at
    more than one pathname, which is what decides the write-ahead log. `links` is reported
    beside the pair because it catches one kind of second pathname, the hardlink; a bind mount
    adds one without changing it, so a count of one settles nothing. What settles a shared
    store is `store-challenge` and `doctor --expect-nonce` TOGETHER with the peer's
    `--expect-inode`: the nonce is the live half, and since a copy taken after the challenge
    carries it, the physical identity is the half that says the file is still the same one.

    The identity and the participants come out of ONE read for the same reason. Collected by
    two separate opens, an atomic replacement between them would pair one store's identity
    with another store's participants and the receipt would say nothing about it - a mismatch
    invisible in exactly the comparison this exists to support. One statement carries both,
    and what it returns is checked against what the probe measured - the store id AND the
    device and inode the rows were actually read from. The id alone was not that check: it is
    minted once and travels with a copy of the bytes, so a replacement by a copy satisfied it.

    Falling through to the canonical directory is not the neutral outcome it looks like. The
    first command that writes there creates a THIRD empty database, and once that exists it
    wins every later resolution and hides the assignments and pending deliveries in both of
    the others. Refusing costs one command; the third store costs the state.

    The same refusal covers a store that records NO socket. Its directory hash cannot be
    inverted, so if it is this socket's - created from a spelling we cannot reconstruct - then
    creating a canonical database beside it hides it just as permanently. That case fires only
    when a store would be created; an existing canonical store has already settled it.

    doctor and ack-proof are exempt for opposite reasons. doctor is how an operator finds out
    which store to pass to --state, so refusing it would remove the only way out. ack-proof is
    a derivation over its own two arguments that opens no store at all.

    An explicit --state or environment override never arrives here: both return from
    resolve_state_dir before any discovery runs, because a caller who named a directory has
    already decided which participants share it.

    This guard is on the command line rather than on Services.store. A library caller that
    builds Services itself bypasses it; every in-process caller in this package passes an
    explicit directory, and raising from a property would turn a diagnostic into a crash.
