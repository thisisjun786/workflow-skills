"""One issue, one responsible child, and where that assignment actually stands.

Derived rather than stored, except for the one fact the relay cannot observe. The relay sees
registration, receipts, claims, verdicts and generations; it cannot see a merge, so merged is the
single explicit mark. Deriving the rest means the state cannot drift away from the records it is
supposed to summarise.

A mark is bound to the exact revision it is about. Keyed on the relationship alone, one old merge
would have labelled every later generation merged, which is the opposite of what a coordinator
needs from this view. A mark that no longer matches the current head is history, and history is
returned as history.
