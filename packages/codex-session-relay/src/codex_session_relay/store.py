"""The durable store. One writer, one schema, one transaction helper.

Two rules shape everything here. Every state transition is committed before its side
effect, so a crash leaves a recoverable state rather than an ambiguous one. And a failed
transition is never a success: the transaction helper rolls back on any exception,
including KeyboardInterrupt, so a partial record cannot survive.

The schema is written once, by this module, with every column the delivery, reconciliation
and acknowledgement layers will need, so no later phase has to migrate it.

    Conflicting evidence is decided before agreeing evidence, so an easier comparison that
    happened to succeed can never talk a mismatch down. Absence is never agreement: a store
    that cannot state its identity is unproven, not proven, because the criterion is that a
    different database must never be reported as healthy.

    What each piece of evidence can carry differs, and the grades follow that. A store id is
    minted once and copied with the bytes, so agreement is never proof. A device and inode
    pair is conclusive when it DIFFERS and insufficient when it agrees, because one inode can
    be reached at more than one pathname and SQLite derives the write-ahead log from the
    pathname a connection opens. Neither a hardlink name nor a file bind mount is visible from
    this side: the caller holds its own path and the peer's device and inode, and nothing that
    says which pathname the peer opened. A nonce is the only live evidence here - the peer's
    write is readable in the file being read - and it is what the contract designates as proof.

    Being the only proof, it has to be evidence about THIS file. The answer carries the
    identity of the file it was read from, because it comes from a second open of the path,
    and a found nonce is graded as proof only when that matches the store being compared. An
    answer that cannot be attributed is unproven rather than a mismatch: it says nothing about
    whether two participants share a store, only that this reading is not about the one here.

    And being live is not the same as being current. What a found nonce says is that the file
    read here contains a write that was made to the writer's file at some earlier moment - a
    copy taken AFTER the challenge was written carries it with the bytes, and stays stable for
    a whole invocation, so nothing looking for a replacement or a second name sees anything
    wrong. Whether it is still one file is what the physical identity answers. So proof takes
    both: a found, attributed nonce AND an agreeing device and inode. Neither alone is graded
    as proof, and each is unproven for its own reason.

    The name count is graded beside all of that rather than folded into any of it. It catches
    one concrete case and only one: `st_nlink` counts hardlink names, and a bind mount adds a
    pathname without changing it. So more than one name refuses, and one name is not evidence
    of a single pathname - which is exactly why an agreeing pair is not proof by itself.
