"""The regression map's own inventories, derived from source rather than asserted in prose.

Two independent review rounds on the plan behind this work re-opened the same two
categories: evidence claimed as new that already existed, and clock provenance stated
wrongly. Patching the instances a third time would have been the third round of one
mistake. This package already has the answer to that shape - guard.EVALUATION_STAGES is
checked against the injections that exercise it, so a stage added without being listed
fails here rather than in review - and this applies it to the map.

What this closes: a citation that no longer resolves, a criterion whose clock label
disagrees with the modules it names, a count the map prints that nothing reads, and - added
after the sweep this file backs turned out to be narrower than its own sentence - the reach of
that sweep itself. The boolean-summary inventory below is the third of these derived lists and
the largest: every boolean the package folds out of more than one input, every place the suite
measures something with one, and a written verdict beside each of those places.

What it does NOT close, stated so nobody reads more into a green run than is there. Whether a
new test asserts something an existing test already asserts: no scan can answer that, and the
map's reuse column is where that judgement is written down rather than enforced. And whether
any verdict below is the RIGHT reading of its site: the scan supplies the reach and which value
an assertion pins, a person supplies the verdict, and a wrong verdict fails nothing here. Two
of them were wrong when this landed and review caught both by mutation rather than by reading.

    join or a lock acquisition blocks until another thread arrives rather than until a

# ---------------------------------------------------------- the sweep's own reach
#
# The map's sweep clause used to say five modules were checked. That is a claim about the
# sweeper. What follows produces the reach instead: which places in this suite measure a
# property with a boolean the production source folded, what each of those booleans folds,
# and - the part that matters - what this reader could NOT see, emitted as data rather than
# left to prose.
#
# What is derived and what is written down are different things, and conflating them would be
# the same overstatement. DERIVED: the inventory, the polarities, the blind spots. WRITTEN
# DOWN: whether the summary at a site means the same thing as the condition its test is named
# for. That is a reading judgement and no scan performs it; every site carries one.
#
# Boundaries, stated because a boundary nobody wrote down is how a sweep ends up claiming more
# than it reached:
#   - this package only, and only bool-annotated fields and bool-returning functions;
#   - matching is by name, so a local named like a summary function and then called counts;
#   - a value carried through an alias, a dict key or **kwargs is not followed;
#   - FOLD_FREE_BOOLEANS is declared by key alone, so it cannot show a constant producer being
#     swapped for another constant. It cannot hide a FOLD: a symbol that starts folding moves
#     lists and breaks the partition below. Listing those producers verbatim would copy
#     production SQL into this module and fail it on an unrelated query edit.

# --------------------------------------------- where this suite injects store faults
#
# The sweep above derives which booleans this suite measures WITH. This derives where it
# breaks things on purpose, which is the other way a case can assert nothing. The store's
# fault hook is global and fires just before every COMMIT, so an arming reaches whichever
# transaction runs first rather than the one the case is named for - and a case can then
# pass in a situation its own name does not describe. Every hook-shaped CANDIDATE this
# reader recognises is enumerated from source and carries the interval it reaches and a
# reading. Candidate, not arming: this reader cannot tell a Store from anything else, so it
# over-reports on purpose in the one direction that is safe, and the paragraph below says
# how far recognition goes.
#
# What this is, and what it does NOT claim. The claim was rewritten four times under review
# and was wrong three of them, which is the best argument for stating it exactly.
#
# This is a scope-blind, flow-blind reader of syntax, not Python name resolution. It
# recognises: an attribute assignment whose attribute is the hook; a call whose callee names
# the helper; a call to setattr, exec, eval or __setattr__; a __dict__ subscript assignment;
# a string containing the hook's name; a read of the hook; the helper named without being
# called; and a binding of the helper or of setattr, exec or eval to some other name, read
# one level down an assignment, an annotated assignment, a walrus or an import-as. Every one
# of those becomes a site or an unaccounted occurrence, and THAT is the only totality
# claimed. Over-reporting is deliberate where it happens: a hook-named attribute on an
# unrelated object costs somebody a declaration, and missing one hides an arming.
#
# It deliberately does not follow a binding. Resolving aliases is what an earlier version
# did, and it answered wrongly twice: once reporting a raw reflective arming as a helper site
# because the same local name appeared in two functions, and once for obj.arm(). A reader
# that answers "helper" for a raw arming hides exactly what this exists to surface, which is
# worse than one that says "somebody bound this name, go and read it". So a binding is
# reported and the call made through it is not classified at all.
#
# Out of reach, and not claimed absent: an arming reached through a resolved alias, a
# closure, a callback, a name looked up at runtime, or any other reflection.
#
# As with SUMMARY_SITES above: the scan supplies the reach, a person supplies the verdict,
# and a wrong verdict fails nothing here.
