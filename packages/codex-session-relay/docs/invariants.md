# Invariants

JSON Schema is the structural layer only. Everything here is contract prose or observed host
behaviour that the schema cannot express, with the code that actually refuses. Each row carries a
status. Every row below is implemented and carries a test; the suite is the proof, not this table.

## Identity and registration

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-01 | Relationship id is deterministic, so re-registration is idempotent | `identity.relationship_id`, `registry.register` | implemented |
| I-02 | Identity is actual task ids; no title or "latest session" is ever a routing key | `registry` accepts only `Endpoint(taskId, hostId, cwd)`; no name reaches the routing path | implemented |
| I-03 | The current generation must exist in the retained generation list | `registry._assert_generation_invariant` | implemented |
| I-04 | Replaying one dispatch request id opens no second generation | `registry.open_generation` looks up by dispatch request id first | implemented |
| I-05 | A pending anchor never auto-binds to whichever turn appears next | `registry.bind_anchor` requires an explicit turn id and a dispatch-receipt source | implemented |
| I-06 | A receipt under an unbound generation is refused, and the pending anchor stays reportable | `receipts._check_generation` | implemented |
| I-07 | A superseded relationship is preserved, never rewritten | `registry.supersede` writes links on both sides; the original record blob is immutable | implemented |

## Scope and artifact authorization

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-10 | Containment is by path component, so `/a/b` does not contain `/a/bc` | `scope.is_within` | implemented |
| I-11 | The bytes that are hashed are provably inside an authorized root | `scope.open_authorized`: a pinned walk from `/` opening every component with `O_NOFOLLOW`, then `readlink("/proc/self/fd/N")` must equal the declared path, then hashing from that descriptor | implemented |
| I-12 | The declared normalized absolute path enters the digest unchanged | `manifest.canonical_payload` uses the declared string verbatim; authorization never rewrites it | implemented |
| I-13 | A recipient outside the authorized list is refused before any transport call | `delivery.enqueue` and `delivery.attempt`, the second immediately before the adapter call | implemented |
| I-80 | A path whose ancestor is relocated mid-resolution is refused, not read | the `/proc/self/fd` check above; `ELOOP`/`ENOTDIR` map to a symlink refusal, `ENOENT`/`ESTALE` to a path-changed refusal | implemented |

## Receipts and classification

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-20 | A completed turn with no child receipt is an ordinary turn end, never success | `receipts.classify_observation` | implemented |
| I-21 | A daemon observation may assert only failure or interruption | `receipts.daemon_observation` | implemented |
| I-22 | Blocked-needs-input is a child assertion only | same; also a recorded capability limit, since approvals are unsupported end to end | implemented |
| I-23 | A reviewable claim is verified against actual bytes, not trusted | `manifest.verify_against_disk` re-hashes every file; truncation or absence refuses | implemented |
| I-24 | The digest is recomputed by the consumer | `receipts` recomputes from the manifest and compares | implemented |
| I-25 | Event ids are recomputed and compared | `identity.event_id` plus an intake comparison | implemented |
| I-26 | The turn reference must equal the observation that accompanied the receipt | intake comparison | implemented |
| I-27 | One revision collapses on re-observation; a different revision is a separate retained target | events keyed by event id; a new digest yields a new id and both rows persist | implemented |
| I-28 | Any outcome other than reviewable carries a null manifest and the no-deliverable sentinel, for any producer | `receipts._check_outcome_consistency`, branching on outcome before producer | implemented |
| I-29 | Artifact bytes are only ever read | no write mode anywhere in the package; asserted by test | implemented |
| I-75 | A frozen manifest copy keeps the original declared paths, so relocation does not change the digest | `manifest.freeze` and `manifest.verify_frozen` | implemented |

## Delivery

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-30 | An active recipient is never interrupted; the send is withheld before any resume | pre-check in `delivery.attempt`, plus the transport's own busy guard | implemented |
| I-31 | Model, effort, sandbox and approval policy are never changed | the only mutating call carries a request id, a thread id and a message; no overrides exist | implemented |
| I-32 | The error code is classified before the method prefix | `transport.classify_operation_receipt` | implemented |
| I-33 | An unfinished receipt is never proven non-delivery | unfinished maps to unknown and uncertain | implemented |
| I-34 | Retry-safe is true only for a completed, attributable pre-send rejection | `transport`, re-checked by `delivery._assert_attempt_invariants` | implemented |
| I-35 | Dispatched is not acknowledgement | the aggregate state stays dispatched until an acknowledgement row exists | implemented |
| I-36 | A returned turn id is checked, not assumed to be a fresh turn | `delivery._check_turn_identity` compares against turn ids known before the send | implemented |
| I-37 | A retry never replays a cached failure under one request id | attempt numbers always increment; a settled attempt row is immutable | implemented |
| I-38 | An inbox-only fallback is never reported as a wake | reported as stored-not-woken and held, not retried | implemented |
| I-39 | A request-id collision across different events is detected, not cross-wired | the request id is a primary key | implemented |
| I-70 | Claiming a delivery and allocating its attempt are one transaction | a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` does the conditional update and the attempt insert | implemented |
| I-78 | A lease prevents a second concurrent claimer and authorizes nothing on expiry | expiry hands the attempt to reconciliation, which still requires evidence | implemented |
| I-11b | The rendered message is deterministic, so one request id keeps one transport fingerprint | `delivery.render_message` derives only from the stored event | implemented |

## Reconciliation and recovery

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-40 | Fixed order: the operation receipt first, then the recipient's real turns | `reconcile.reconcile_attempt` records which step ran | implemented |
| I-41 | Exactly three things are affirmative evidence, and elapsed time is not one | the evidence enum has no time input | implemented |
| I-42 | A truncated scan is inconclusive, never proof of absence | the scan reports whether it exhausted the cursor | implemented |
| I-43 | Same-direction paging uses the forward cursor, with a total scan bound | `bridge_adapter.find_token`; the reverse cursor is only for a direction change | implemented |
| I-44 | Every state transition is committed before its side effect | the claim transaction commits before the adapter is called | implemented |
| I-45 | An interrupted transition leaves no partial record | `store.transaction` rolls back on any exception | implemented |
| I-46 | Paused, cancelled and archived relationships are never auto-resumed | eligibility joins on active status; resume requires restated generation and scope | implemented |
| I-71 | Reconciliation never fabricates an accepted transport status | the transport snapshot is re-derived only from a fresher receipt for the same request id | implemented |
| I-72 | A missing transport ledger row is an observation, not affirmative evidence | the adapter maps the transport's unknown-request error to a missing observation | implemented |
| I-79 | No default-reachable configuration permits an attempt without one of the three affirmative evidences | operator release defaults to disabled | implemented |

## Acknowledgement and the reverse direction

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-50 | Only the parent, from inside a real turn, closes dispatched to acknowledged | `ack.acknowledge` verifies the turn in the recipient's real turn list | implemented |
| I-51 | The proof is supplied by the parent and verified, never computed for the caller | `ack.acknowledge` refuses on mismatch | implemented |
| I-51b | The delivered message contains no parent turn id | asserted by test | implemented |
| I-52 | An acknowledging turn must have started after the delivery | compared against the attempt's observation time | implemented |
| I-53 | An unverifiable turn does not close the attempt | stored as unverified; the delivery state is unchanged | implemented |
| I-54 | Duplicate delivery cannot cause a second verification | `ack.claim_verification` is an idempotent insert keyed on event id, reopened only where `ack._re_review_open` holds and `ack._ruling_is_current` does not | implemented |
| I-55 | A revision routes to the same child under a new generation | `ack.record_verdict` opens the generation on the same relationship | implemented |
| I-73 | A verdict requires an acknowledged event | `ack.record_verdict` | implemented |
| I-74 | The child must be an authorized recipient before a revision is queued | checked before anything is written | implemented |
| I-76 | The reverse direction is stored as a relay-internal record, outside the parent-shaped schemas | delivery rows carry a kind; conformance validation partitions by kind | implemented |
| I-77 | Acknowledgement and disposition evaluation are unreachable for a revision request | kind guards raise | implemented |
| I-143 | A verified acknowledgement is settled, and a competing disposition cannot replace it | `ack.acknowledge` re-reads the acknowledgement as the first statement inside its write transaction and returns the stored record whatever the caller asked for | implemented |
| I-144 | A criteria edit reopens a review only on the revision this generation still stands on, under an active relationship, and only where any ruling already recorded is a verified one | `ack._re_review_open`, read by `claim_verification` against the bound digest and by `record_verdict` against the digest the recorded ruling was decided on | implemented |
| I-144b | Reopening a review rebinds it to the set in force, so reopening stays idempotent and does not turn the claim into one anyone can take | `ack.claim_verification` replaces `claim_context` in the same transaction; the next claim finds it current and is refused | implemented |
| I-144c | A re-review names the set it read, so the ruling it replaces cannot be re-submitted as its own re-review | `ack.record_verdict` requires `expect_criteria_digest` on the re-review path, which `cli.py` already carries as `--expect-criteria-digest` | implemented |
| I-145 | A re-review replaces what the assignment stands on, never the record of deciding it | `ack.record_verdict` journals `verdict_superseded` with the replaced ruling and both criteria digests | implemented |
| I-146 | A re-review may rule only verified or needs_changes, because those are the two dispositions the assignment has a state for; replacing a certification with one it does not would strand it | `ack.record_verdict` refuses the other two on that path only, leaving both available on an event with no ruling | implemented |

## Bounds

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-60 | Repeated failure cannot become an infinite wake | an attempt cap, then a hold that is observable and never auto-retried | implemented |
| I-61 | A busy recipient is not a failure, but is still bounded | a separate cap and backoff curve | implemented |
| I-62 | No notification flood | a per-recipient minimum interval and hourly cap | implemented |
| I-63 | Unchanged states stay quiet | a tick that changes nothing writes no journal rows | implemented |
| I-64 | An unbounded daemon loop is not constructible | `run` requires a tick count, a deadline or a stop signal | implemented |
| I-65 | A supervisor is bounded by the owner's intent, not by a timer | it re-reads `service.json` and the stop request between segments; `RelayDaemon.run` is unchanged, so every worker it launches is still bounded by I-64 | implemented |
| I-66 | The current generation cannot be starved by history | candidates are filtered before the per-tick budget, the current anchor is reserved, and the remainder rotates through a persisted cursor | implemented |
| I-67 | One parent's backlog cannot consume another parent's opportunity | selection asks which parents are eligible before asking how many rows each has, then deals a bounded share one at a time | implemented |
| I-68 | A delivery whose generation has moved on cannot be claimed | the claim statement refuses it, so the decision cannot be overtaken between checking and acting | implemented |
| I-69 | An outstanding send is never rewritten as terminal | suppression annotates it instead, because reconciliation refuses to promote a terminal superseded aggregate and a lost response would become unresolvable | implemented |

## Work reports and the CXC report contract

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-90 | A CXC report status never chooses a relay outcome; it is checked against the one the receipt asserted | `cxc.check_status`, called from `report.record` | implemented |
| I-91 | An unrecognised report status is refused by name, with the accepted set and the contract version | `cxc.check_status` | implemented |
| I-92 | DONE, an open pull request, a review PASS and a green check are never a relay verdict | `cxc.NOT_VERIFICATION`, `cxc.refuse_promotion`; no path writes a verdict outside `ack.record_verdict` | implemented |
| I-93 | A verdict line is rendered only for a message carrying a review, in the fixed PASS / GO-WITH-FIXES (blockers=N) / FAIL form | `cxc.verdict_line`, `cxc.assert_reviewed` | implemented |
| I-94 | A report is bound to one event, generation and revision, and cannot answer for a later head | `report.assert_current` | implemented |
| I-95 | A pull request number is never rendered or compared without its repository | `report.pr_ref`, `report.pr_key` | implemented |
| I-96 | A report naming a pull request names the head commit it is about | `report.record` | implemented |
| I-97 | A shortened message names what it dropped and where to read it; a budget too small to hold the required parts refuses | `report._compose` | implemented |
| I-98 | An event with no work report renders the pre-contract message unchanged | `delivery._render_completion`, `delivery._render_revision` | implemented |
| I-99 | A wait result never authorises a re-run, and a bare timeout is neither failure nor success | `cxc.classify_wait` | implemented |
| I-100 | A report reads its relationship, generation, revision and outcome from the stored event; no caller supplies them | `report.record` | implemented |
| I-101 | A correction names the criteria the recorded verdict names; a review only adds notes and anchors, and anything it raises alone is labelled | `report._finding_lines` | implemented |
| I-102 | A shape or length that could only fail at render time is refused at record time, because rendering runs inside the delivery claim | `report._check_evidence`, `_check_unresolved`, `_bounded` | implemented |
| I-103 | A submission already frozen into a delivered attempt cannot be replaced in place; one never sent stays correctable | `report._assert_resubmission` against `attempt_report_submissions` | implemented |
| I-104 | An omission notice is placed before the final verdict, so an elided correction still ends on its judgment | `report._compose` | implemented |
| I-105 | A revision request cannot carry a PASS verdict | `report.record` | implemented |
| I-106 | A report-backed message keeps the receipt manifestRef the pre-contract message carried | `report._manifest_lines` | implemented |
| I-107 | The command an omission notice names returns the whole report, so every elided field stays recoverable | `cli.cmd_show` | implemented |
| I-108 | A restore section naming a skill owner nobody has is refused at record time | `report._check_restore` | implemented |
| I-109 | The frozen-manifest pointer is its own section, so shortening the file listing never drops it | `report._manifest_ref_lines` | implemented |
| I-110 | Every malformed report shape is a named refusal, never a host exception from the validator itself | `report._check_restore`, `_check_evidence`, `_check_unresolved` | implemented |
| I-111 | Every report field that lands on a line the composer cannot shorten is length-bounded at record time | `report._bounded`, `_bounded_optional` | implemented |
| I-112 | A collection field that is not an ordered sequence is refused rather than iterated, so a mapping never becomes a list of its own keys and a string never becomes a list of characters | `report._sequence` | implemented |
| I-113 | Recording a later submission preserves the earlier one, so a recipient holding an older elided message can still recover what it promised | `report.record` keyed on (event, submission); `report.read_all`; `cli.cmd_show` | implemented |
| I-114 | Every delivered message states its report submission and survives elision doing so, so the frozen bytes identify which stored submission produced them | `report.render_completion`, `render_revision`; the identity is its own section with a floor covering it | implemented |
| I-115 | A report with no pull request still renders its base, head and criteria digest rather than dropping them unannounced | `report._commit_lines` | implemented |
| I-116 | An attempt that is proven never to have sent is not counted as a delivered submission; anything unproven is | `report._may_have_reached` | implemented |
| I-117 | A manifest reference too long to render is truncated visibly rather than making the event unsendable | `report._manifest_ref_lines` | implemented |
| I-118 | A submission number is a positive integer or a named refusal, never a coerced one, because it is half the identity and is printed in frozen bytes | `report._submission` | implemented |
| I-119 | An exit code is an integer or absent, so evidence a reader cannot interpret is refused rather than delivered | `report._exit_code` | implemented |
| I-120 | An inbox-only attempt counts as having reached the recipient, because its frozen message is the durable inbox item | `report._may_have_reached` | implemented |
| I-121 | No report value, top-level or nested, may contain a line break, so nothing can splice an extra line into the message protocol | `report._single_line`, applied to fields, evidence, unresolved, findings and restore | implemented |
| I-125 | A blocker count too large to render is refused, because it lands on a line the message cannot shorten | `cxc.verdict_line` | implemented |
| I-126 | A required report field must be text, not a value coerced through `str()` into a Python repr | `report._required` | implemented |
| I-127 | A line break is anything `str.splitlines` treats as one, so a separator other than CR or LF cannot splice a line either | `report._single_line` | implemented |
| I-128 | A correction renders the unresolved items the report marked open, rather than storing them unseen | `report.render_revision` | implemented |
| I-129 | A pull request number outside what the store can hold is refused, not left to raise `OverflowError` on insert | `report.record` | implemented |
| I-130 | A finding disposition is one of the frozen criteria values, checked rather than passed through | `report._disposition` | implemented |
| I-131 | The verdict parser and the verdict renderer accept the same language, including the blocker ceiling | `cxc.parse_verdict_line` | implemented |
| I-132 | Every producer-supplied integer is inside what the store can hold, and its refusal never tries to print an unprintable value | `report._submission`, `report.record` | implemented |
| I-133 | A blank evidence entry is refused, because an empty verification line is not verification | `report._check_evidence` | implemented |
| I-134 | A finding that exists only to enrich an authoritative one needs no disposition of its own | `report._disposition` | implemented |
| I-135 | A line value that cannot be encoded as UTF-8 is refused where it is recorded, not where it is measured or sent | `report._single_line` | implemented |
| I-136 | A correction carries the CXC status and its reason, like a completion does | `report.render_revision` | implemented |
| I-137 | One criterion carries one finding; a duplicate id is refused rather than silently replacing the first | `report._check_review` | implemented |
| I-138 | Shortening carries a running byte total rather than recounting, so it stays linear inside the claim transaction | `report._compose` | implemented |
| I-139 | Fixed protocol prose is never shortened away, because the advertised command returns records and not template text | `report._preserve_lines` | implemented |
| I-140 | Every producer-supplied text field is required to be text, never coerced through `str()` into a representation of itself | `report._required`, `_text_or_none`, and the evidence, unresolved and finding checks | implemented |
| I-141 | An exit code is a number a process could have exited with, so it can always be serialised | `report._exit_code` | implemented |
| I-142 | An unrenderable receipt manifestRef is reported as present rather than blocking the delivery, because the receipt is contract-validated and the recipient is not at fault | `report._manifest_ref_lines` | implemented |
| I-122 | Pull-request fields are refused when no pull request is named, rather than stored and never rendered | `report.record` | implemented |
| I-123 | Every restore field is a supported, bounded, single-line string; an unsupported or unrenderable one is refused | `report._check_restore` | implemented |
| I-124 | A submission must clear both floors, the delivered one and the highest stored one, so no write is accepted that nobody would ever see | `report._assert_resubmission` | implemented |


## The managed marker and the Stop decision

A hook that only inspects registered relationships cannot see a missing registration, so the marker
exists before the relationship and is answerable without asking the relay anything.

| Invariant | Why |
|---|---|
| Every fact is published once | a sibling temp is fsynced, linked and unlinked, so first-publication-wins is an operating-system fact rather than a convention a writer might forget, and a reader arriving mid-race sees a subset of files, which is always a valid earlier state |
| A fact is published whole or not at all | `os.write` may return a short count, so the write loops; a fact that cannot be written in full is never linked, because a truncated create-once record is one no retry can replace |
| The assignment state is derived, never stored | a stored state would need every writer to agree on transition rules, and every delayed writer would then be a regression risk; presence is monotonic, so a late fact cannot move it backwards |
| Binding is the coordinator's alone | only the party holding the creation receipt can tell the task it created from a session that read an id, so a child claims and never binds |
| An identity names something only as a nonempty string | missing, empty, blank and non-string all name nothing, and two records naming nothing are never a match: `None == None` is not evidence |
| An identity used as a directory name is stricter still | a session or turn id that is `.`, `..` or contains a separator names something perfectly well and would redirect a create-once write out of its assignment, so the writers refuse it |
| A receipt is this turn's or it is nothing | the head is computed first and the matching event fetched by its id, then checked against this session, this turn and this assignment's relationship; a receipt from an earlier turn can stand at the head while the turn being judged produced nothing |
| Staged receipts count, suppressed ones do not | a child emits inside its own turn, so the host reports `inProgress` and the event is stored staged until the daemon observes the turn ending, which is after the hook has run; requiring `final` would hold every honest child, while `suppressed_reason` keeps a failed or interrupted turn from carrying one |
| The store to read is the coordinator's, not the caller's guess | precedence is the explicit path, then the `dbPath` recorded in `intent.json`, then the caller's own resolution; a hook resolving its own default can read a different store, find no relationship, and hold a child whose receipt is at the head of the right one |
| The guard reads the relay read-only | `Store` writes on open, so a guard built on it would create an empty database at a misresolved path, and an empty database answers "no receipt", which is a hold |
| Nothing is synthesized for the hook | no receipt is written, no verdict recorded and nothing marked verified; when the evidence is missing the answer is to say so |
| Every evaluation returns a classified result, and records it wherever there is somewhere to record | it does not end in an uncaught exception, does not read a failure as a normal state, and does not silently skip enforcement; the outside-world stages are enumerated in `guard.EVALUATION_STAGES` and each has an injected-failure case. Persistence depends on an assignment directory having been selected, so an evaluation that could not read the workspace, or whose Stop identity cannot be a directory name, is classified and returned but has nowhere to be written; those answer with a null `recordedAs` |
| A defect here is not a data problem | an exception escaping any stage becomes `guard_faulted` carrying its type and message, kept distinct from `state_unreadable` so a bug in this code cannot masquerade as a corrupt marker |
| Corruption is scoped to what it can affect | the rolling window is a bound on one session, so another session's records are skipped before they are parsed and cannot disable enforcement for this one |
| An uncountable budget releases | a hold bound that could not be counted is not an empty one, so the evaluation reports it rather than narrowing its scope and silently renewing the budget |
| One guarded primitive answers every directory question | `Path.is_dir`, `Path.exists` and their `os.path` siblings swallow an access error and return an ordinary value, so a directory nobody may read reports as one that is not there. The classification boundary cannot catch that, because a swallowed error never becomes an exception. `marker.listing` is the one implementation that catches it, and a test enumerates the predicate names and fails on any call site outside it that is not justified in place |
| A path that came from a record is resolved before it is trusted | the marker subtree is writable by the parties publishing into it, so a symlink planted there would carry a create-once write anywhere the process can reach; `publish` resolves the parent and requires it to stay under the marker root, and `O_NOFOLLOW` covers the final component |
| A database path names a file and never configures the connection | the path is absolutised before the URI is built, because `Path.as_uri` raises on a relative one and that exception was being read as "the store is unreadable"; `as_uri` also percent-encodes, which is what stops a name containing `?` or `#` from being re-read as SQLite URI parameters |
| Registration is confirmed by the relay, not by the caller's restatement | an assignment id is the hash of a dispatch request id, so pairing an unrelated relationship with the right dispatch id satisfies every check the filesystem can make; the `generations` table is the only place that knows which relationship a dispatch actually opened, and an unreadable store refuses the registration rather than taking the caller's word |
| This turn's hold is claimed, not counted | a count read before the decision lets two evaluations of one Stop both see an unspent budget and both block, exceeding the bound they were checking; a create-once reservation at `hook/<session>/<turn>/hold.json` has exactly one winner, and it is separate from the observation record because that one is sequence-numbered so a second observation is never lost |
| A hold is claimed inside the subtree the hook is granted | the contract grants the hook process `hook/<own session>/` and nothing else, so a reservation anywhere outside it is refused by the very sandbox that makes holding permissible, and the refusal surfaces as a released fault. The reservation is a named file beside the numbered observations in that directory, so the two share it without colliding |
| A reservation is given back only when its record fails | it is taken before the observation is published, so a recording failure would otherwise spend the turn's only hold with nothing blocked and nothing recorded, and that is the only case that removes it. A hold whose observation WAS published keeps its file on purpose: the file is what the per-turn, generation and rolling-window bounds count, so erasing it after a successful record would renew the budgets it exists to spend. Losing it to a crash instead costs one hold, which the remaining bounds still catch |
| The receipt is read from one snapshot | Python's sqlite3 starts no transaction for SELECTs, so a concurrent writer could move the head between computing it and fetching the event it named; the three reads share an explicit deferred transaction |
| A receipt is valid for the revision it was computed over | standing at the head is a statement about lineage and says nothing about whether the artifacts are still those artifacts, so a receipt is re-verified against the relationship's own `artifact_roots` under the rule `ReceiptIntake._verify_bytes` already applies: live bytes first, and the frozen copy consulted only when the live bytes disagree. A changed deliverable is a readable answer that holds; artifacts that could not be read are reported apart from it, because the two are repaired in different places |
| A hold is only issued where it can be recorded | a hold is reserved, counted against three bounds and released by the record that explains it, so an evaluation asked not to record downgrades to observe and names the downgrade in the verdict instead of spending a turn's budget on a decision nothing durable accounts for; the command line refuses the combination outright |
| A publication that failed says so | `record_observation` raises on an unreadable directory and on an exhausted retry loop rather than returning the same value it uses for "there was nothing to name", so the caller's release path runs and the reservation is given back; `intent._publish_numbered` is the same loop and has always raised on both |
| Bytes that are not text are bytes we could not read | UnicodeDecodeError is a ValueError and not an OSError, so a handler written to mean "this file could not be read" lets it straight past. Reading a marker fact catches both, because a corrupt file escaping to the classification boundary is reported as guard_faulted, which says the defect is in this code rather than in somebody's marker - the exact conflation guard_faulted exists to prevent, arriving from the other direction |
| An unreachable frozen copy is not a changed deliverable | verify_frozen catches its own access errors and returns them as problem strings, so they never become exceptions and the boundary that converts exceptions cannot see them. verify_frozen_detailed reports which of the problems were failures to read, and the guard answers unverifiable rather than claiming a comparison against bytes nobody opened |
| An error returned as text is invisible to an exception boundary | scope reports an unopenable component as a refusal, and both manifest verifiers catch it and hand it back as a problem string, so nothing ever raises and the classification boundary cannot see it. Each verifier has a detailed form reporting which of its problems were failures to read, and a test asserts that the set of such helpers reachable from the guard is exactly those two, so a third one entering the path fails there rather than in review |
| A claim names the dispatch its assignment hashes from | an assignment id IS the hash of a dispatch request id, so a claim naming a different dispatch belongs to a different assignment. A claim is what the guard requires before holding a session the coordinator bound, so an uncorrelated one must not be able to satisfy it; the reader checks as well, because a file written by anything at all is what actually gets judged |
| Only directories are assignments | the per-session window walks the workspace, and listing everything meant a stray regular file was scanned as an assignment, raised NotADirectoryError, reported the budget uncountable and released a holdable omission. An ordinary file must not be able to switch holding off for a workspace |
| Managed is decided by absence, not by shape | the explicit inspection view tested whether the intent was an object, so one that parsed into something else answered unmanaged and told an operator a managed workspace was ordinary. Selection keeps a wrong-shaped fact so it can be reported as malformed, and the diagnostic view now gives the same answer the decision does |
| A dispatch registers only the generation it opened | generations keeps one row per generation, so a relationship that has moved on still carries the older dispatch, and asking whether a row exists proves that SOME generation used it rather than the live one. The head is computed over the relationship's current generation, so a stale assignment registered that way would release turns on work belonging to a later one. Stale is answered apart from absent, because an old generation is a state the contract requires to be distinguished |
| A fact that names nothing has registered nothing | the relationship record was tested for truthiness rather than for its identity, so one carrying a blank or missing relationshipId read as registered; the receipt lookup then refused the unnamed id and the turn landed on receipt_missing, telling the child to emit a receipt that nothing could satisfy. The identity is what is tested, the same way the bind record has always been |
| A failed publication leaves no litter | the temp is this call's own, so a write or fsync failure removes it; leaving it turned a transient fault into an unbounded pile of orphans in a directory every reader walks |

## Three-level linkage and execution ownership

they implement is OPS-7.4 and the shared "Supervisor, parent and child scope".

| # | Invariant | Enforced in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-150 | A scope has one live owner per role | partial unique index on `scope_bindings`, and `linkage._binding_refusal` before it | implemented |
| I-151 | A task holds one live scope per role; a second live binding of the same role is refused rather than silently tie-broken | `linkage._binding_refusal` → `role_already_bound` | implemented |
| I-152 | Only `(initiative, project)` and `(project, issue)` are execution edges, so a reference or a peer row can neither lengthen a chain nor add an owner | every walk filters `link_kind = 'execution'` in SQL: `linkage.down`, `_descend`, `up` | implemented |
| I-153 | A project has at most one live execution supervision, whichever initiative asks | `linkage._supervision_refusal` → `duplicate_scope_owner` | implemented |
| I-154 | A reference carries no directive authority and cannot be a project's first link | `linkage._supervision_refusal` → `unregistered_scope`; `record_directive` refuses a directive arriving on a reference edge | implemented |
| I-155 | The initiative that supervises a project cannot also reference it, so one scope pair never holds two live edges | `linkage._supervision_refusal` → `link_conflict` | implemented |
| I-156 | A peer link between two parents introduces no cycle and no second execution owner | `linkage.register_peer` and the `_reaches` walk | implemented |
| I-157 | An issue is attached only by the project's live parent, or by a genuine successor: one superseding an assignment that is scoped to that project, assigned to this same issue, and either still live or being taken over by this very registration | `linkage.attach_refusal` → `foreign_scope`, agreeing with `replaceable_child_in` on the write side | implemented |
| I-158 | An issue has one live assignment, decided on the relationship rather than on the child task | `registry._register_in_transaction` → `duplicate_assignment`; `linkage._owns_its_issue` for the lower level | implemented |
| I-159 | A replacement owner restates the outgoing owner and the unfinished work, and a handover that cannot move the whole endpoint refuses and names what it could not move | `linkage.handover` with `attached(other_than=...)` → `handover_unconfirmed`, `handover_would_strand` | implemented |
| I-160 | Reactivating an assignment cannot install a stale owner: the project must still be parented by the task that assignment names | `linkage.apply_relationship_status_in` → `foreign_scope`, covering both `resume` and `set_status` | implemented |
| I-161 | A settled directive is not re-decided; restating the same disposition converges, a different one refuses, and the contest is retained rather than rolled back with the refusal | `linkage.settle_directive` → `link_conflict`, recorded through `_record_conflict_in` before the error is raised | implemented |
| I-162 | A read reports ambiguity rather than choosing a row, whether the ambiguity is two edges for one scope pair, two execution edges into one scope, or two candidate pairs for one message | `up`, `down` and `counterpart` answer `ambiguous` with the candidates, and none uses `LIMIT 1` to settle a contest. `down` separates the recursion path from the visited set, so a scope reached from two parents is contested ownership rather than a cycle | implemented |
| I-163 | A lookup failure is never reported as absence or as completion | `up`, `down` and `counterpart` carry `readable` and a `detail`, and answer `unreadable` rather than empty | implemented |
| I-164 | A relationship releases its issue scope once, when it stops being live, so a later write from an already-dead row cannot take a scope claimed directly in the meantime | `linkage.apply_relationship_status_in` compares the status the relationship held BEFORE the write | implemented |
| I-165 | A task that takes a scope back carries the endpoint it is running from now, not the one from its previous tenure, including a host it has moved to | `apply_binding_plan` and `handover` write `host_id`, `cwd` and `cxc_session` on reactivation rather than only the status; `linkage-handover` accepts all three; the host-mismatch refusal applies to a LIVE binding, where two hosts genuinely contradict each other | implemented |
| I-166 | A replacement takes the issue binding only from a predecessor that is still live and still holds it, so a reclaimed issue produces a refusal rather than an index violation | `linkage.replaceable_child_in`, decided inside each write transaction | implemented |
| I-167 | A successor replaces the assignment for its OWN issue; naming a predecessor from another issue is refused rather than archiving that unrelated assignment | `registry._register_in_transaction` → `relationship_conflict`, with `attach_refusal` holding the same line independently | implemented |
| I-168 | Restoring a binding records the status the caller asked for, the same way the first claim does | `apply_binding_plan` reactivation uses the supplied status rather than forcing `active` | implemented |
| I-169 | An assignment comes back only through the validated path: `set_status` refuses any transition from a dead status into a live one, so `paused` is not a quieter way in than `active`, and `resume` restores the lower level after restating the generation and scope | `registry._write_status` → `relationship_not_active`; `apply_relationship_status_in` tests `lower in LIVE` so the restore runs for whichever live status resume writes | implemented |
| I-170 | A store that already violates one of the partial unique indexes still opens, and says which index it could not enforce | `store.GUARD_INDEXES` applied after the schema script, with `unenforced_indexes` recording a refusal instead of failing the open | implemented |
| I-171 | A contest decided after the pre-check survives the rollback that refuses it | the refusal travels on the raised error and is re-recorded in its own transaction, so it belongs to one call rather than to the `Registry` object | implemented |
| I-172 | A scope with two live owners is reported as a contest, never resolved to one of them | `linkage.owners` and `_sole_owner`: `up`, `down`, `counterpart` and `attachment` answer with `competing_owners` and both candidates, and never report two owners as a gap. `owner()` keeps its single-row answer for the write paths, which run against an installed index and refuse a second owner before it exists | implemented |

## Recorded limits, so a row above is not read as more than it is

| Limit | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Linkage records levels; it does not carry a peer MESSAGE | a registered peer link is a record, not a channel. Delivery, acknowledgement and shared merge order between parents belong to their own issues, and nothing in the rows above shows a message was transported between two parents |
| These rows are proved against a temporary store | the evidence is `packages/codex-session-relay/tests/test_linkage*.py`. Whether an installed relay on a real host records any of this is separate evidence, and a green suite is not an installed runtime |
| Codex native parentage is untouched | these are relay-owned records. Nothing here writes or reads a Codex native `parentThreadId`, so a claim that a thread is registered in the host's own hierarchy or its UI needs host evidence and cannot be read off these rows |
| Ordering is not lineage | a later turn is admitted only by an explicit continuation record; host ordering corroborates and can contradict, never admits |
| Byte stability is enforced only under a read lease | the lease is opt-in because holding one blocks writers for the kernel lease-break timeout; otherwise each detector has a named evasion |
| Inode ownership is not proven | a hardlink or bind mount can expose the same bytes under another authorized path, which the contract permits because it authorizes paths |
| The JSON date-time format is unvalidated | the available validator has no working format checker, so timestamp format is unverified rather than implied |
| Terminal turns are polled, not subscribed | the transport cannot subscribe, so automatic invocation is a bounded poll that then dispatches |
| Transport isolation is per recipient, not per call | the adapter dispatches each submission as its own task and allows one send in flight per recipient, so a stall no longer reaches a different recipient. What is NOT bounded by the caller's budget is how long an abandoned send goes on holding its own recipient: it runs to the transport's own deadline, sized as one RPC timeout per separately bounded stage — three requests (`thread/read`, `thread/resume`, `turn/start`), each of which may first pay `unix_connect` and `initialize` because `AppServer.call` awaits `connect()` before every request and rebuilds whenever the reader task has finished. The bound exists because `rpc.py` awaits the websocket write outside its response timeout, and cancelling a send mid-flight is what produces an unknown outcome instead of a real one |
| That deadline buys finiteness, not sufficiency | it is NOT an upper bound on a legitimately progressing send and cannot be made into one by any multiple of the RPC timeout. The same timer also covers time this send spends waiting on `AppServer._connect_lock` while a DIFFERENT recipient rebuilds, and a queue of such rebuilds ahead of it has no constant bound. So the deadline can fire on a send that was still making progress. What it leaves behind is final: `_guarded_send` writes an `outcome_unknown` receipt on cancellation and re-raises, and nothing replaces that row afterwards. Recovering from it is I-71's business and not this bound's, and what stops a duplicate is that `_settle` never reschedules `held_uncertain` — NOT request-id idempotency, since `derive_request_id` gives each attempt its own id. The bound must not be read as a guarantee that a healthy send finishes inside it; per-stage bounds inside the send, where each wait is attributable to what it waits for, are the shape that would give sufficiency, and that is separate work |
| Transport isolation begins at the connection | `AppServer._connect_lock` serialises establishment, so while one submission is inside `connect()` every other recipient waits, reads included. The per-recipient isolation above starts once a connection exists. The lock is doing necessary work — without it two concurrent submissions would each find no reader and both tear down and rebuild the socket — and it lives in `packages/codex-thread-bridge`, so this is recorded here rather than changed |
| A live process is not a working one | health is computed from staged age, anchor poll freshness and backlog; liveness is reported separately and never counted |
| Archive state can be unknown | an inconclusive listing withholds rather than guessing, and a later observation releases it |
| A head commit is not observable from here | the relay cannot watch a forge, so `assert_current` enforces generation on the delivery path and takes `head_sha` only from a caller that already knows the current head. A push that changes the declared manifest is structurally a new event, because the revision hash and therefore the event id change with it; a push that changes nothing declared is not, and `_check_resubmission` is what stops an old report standing for it silently |
| `work_reports` ships with its composite key | the schema is applied with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, which never reshapes an existing table, so a store created from an intermediate revision of this change that used an event-only key cannot hold a second submission. No released version has this table, so there is nothing to migrate; a store built from such a revision is recreated rather than upgraded. The write itself no longer names a conflict target, so it does not depend on which revision created the table |
| A store is matched to its socket by provenance, not arithmetic | a hash cannot be inverted, so a store created under a spelling we cannot guess is findable only because it recorded which socket it serves. Stores record that from now on and selection asks them before creating a canonical database. A store created before that existed says nothing and is reported under `siblingStores` rather than adopted on a guess, because adopting the wrong store is worse than reporting an ambiguity |
| Ownership decisions are taken under the lock, not beside it | probing the daemon lock and then acting on the result are two operations, and a supervisor can start between them. `stop` and `disable` decide under the lock, and `stop` writes its final record only while holding it: holding it is the proof that nothing is running and nothing can start, and failing to take it is the answer that someone is there. What this does NOT give is mutual exclusion with a supervisor that is already running - that is ownership, decided from the record - and it does not cover the handoff in the three rows below |
| `lock_is_held` answers False when it cannot open the lock file | it is a probe rather than an acquisition, and an `open()` failure - a mode or ACL change on `daemon.lock` - is reported as not held. So `service status` can advertise a free lock that `service start` then cannot take. `daemon_lock_if_free` distinguishes contention from operational failure; this probe does not |
| `disable` writes the shared intent without the lock when the holder looks like ours | when acquisition fails and the record classifies as this installation's, the intent write happens outside the lock. A replacement can acquire the lock in that window, and the write then lands on a supervisor this command never examined, which obeys it at its next worker boundary. `enable` has the same shape. The refusal paths are unaffected; this is the accept path |
| `start` confirms from a record and a separate lock probe | it reads a record matching its own launch id, then probes the lock, then reports success - and a replacement can hold the lock while that record still describes the launch which published it. It also reports before re-checking child exit, so a supervisor that published readiness and then died can be reported as started |
| These are forward fixes | per-assignment settlement does not restore claims a previous global settlement already suppressed, and capped-state annotation does not reach deliveries whose generation advanced before it existed. Historical repair is separate work with its own evidence |
| A re-review is not re-synchronised when it lands on the same disposition | `sync` derives `sync_id` from target, ref, kind, relationship, event, generation, revision and verdict, and enqueues with `INSERT OR IGNORE`. The criteria digest is not part of that identity, so a re-review that rules `verified` a second time produces the same id and no second job: the coordination document keeps the summary written against the earlier wording. A re-review that changes the disposition does enqueue. The local record is complete either way - `verdict_context.set_digest` carries the set actually ruled on and the `verdict_superseded` journal entry carries both digests - so this is a gap in what is pushed outward, not in what is known |
| A claim locks an event, it does not identify who rules | `verification_claims` records that a review is under way and which turn took it, and `record_verdict` has no parameter naming the claim it rules under. A caller still holding findings made against the previous wording is therefore refused only while it cannot name the current digest: if it attests that digest it is accepted, exactly as the documented `expect_criteria_digest` alternative to claiming has always been. This predates re-review, since two callers sharing one claim could always submit each other's findings, and closing it needs a review token in `verification_claims` plus a parameter on `record_verdict` that the CLI would have to pass |
| A classified failure is not a correct classification | the evaluation guarantees that a failure is recorded and named, not that the name is right: a read that could have succeeded may still be reported unreadable. The direction is conservative and the classification carries its reason, so it is reportable rather than silent |
| The stage inventory is declared, not derived | `guard.EVALUATION_STAGES` is a written list checked for coverage by its tests, so a stage added without being listed is untested; the failure-site set it stands in for is not enumerable at all, which is why the stages are the unit |
| The five-second hook budget is not enforced here | the contract's wall clock bounds the hook process, and this is the interface that process calls; the database timeout is held well under it, but a deadline that decides what to emit on expiry belongs with the hook registration |
| Holding is asserted, never proven | `--mode hold` cannot verify the per-session sandbox grant it depends on, because that grant lives in another process's creation settings; the default is observe-only, and the mode is recorded in every observation |
| No hook has run against this | the decision, the bounds and the write protocol are exercised by tests only. Whether a real host invokes this interface, honours a block and delivers the continuation is settled by the JUN-100 host-verification packet for the contract, not for this implementation |
| Only the per-turn hold bound is atomic | the generation and rolling-window bounds are still counts read before the decision, so two evaluations on DIFFERENT turns of one assignment can each pass a generation count and both hold. The contract already accepts this shape: losing a count fails toward one extra hold, which the remaining bounds then catch. One hook registration produces one process per Stop, so the overshoot needs concurrent distinct turns |
| The predicate inventory is a name set over four modules | `SWALLOWING_PREDICATES` lists the stdlib names known to hide an access error, checked across the modules in `OWNED_MODULES`. A predicate outside that set, a helper that wraps one, or a new module outside that list is not covered. The set is enumerable and the failure-site set it stands in for is not, which is why the names are the unit |
| Confinement is checked, not enforced by the kernel | `publish` resolves and compares before writing, so a symlink swapped in between the check and the link is not excluded. The window is small and the writable subtree is the one the sandbox grant already scopes; this is defence in depth, not a capability |
| Re-verification is a check at one instant, not a lease | the deliverable is hashed without requesting a read lease, because a lease blocks writers for the kernel lease-break timeout and this runs inside a five-second hook budget. The guard confirms the bytes matched when it looked; a file replaced after that and before a reviewer reads it is outside what this can see |
| An unverifiable deliverable releases | artifacts this process could not hash are reported as unreadable and release, the same direction the module already takes for anything it could not read, because holding a child over a directory we could not open points the repair at the wrong party. The cause is named in the record rather than folded into the store |
| The sentinel inventory classifies by provenance | Inventory C flags a bare sentinel return reached from a caught exception, from a reported readability flag, or from an exhausted retry loop, and cannot see a failure a function converts into an ordinary classification before returning it. Like the predicate names, the return shapes are enumerable and the failure-site set they stand in for is not |
| The two-value frozen contract is preserved by construction | verify_frozen_detailed computes its problems exactly as verify_frozen always did and adds the access breakdown beside them; verify_frozen is that function with the breakdown dropped. The receipt intake path is unchanged, and the tests that assert it pass unchanged against both revisions, which is the only evidence that a shared module was safe to touch |
| The decode inventory is a name set over five modules | read_text, decode, and open() with an encoding are enumerable and are checked across OWNED_MODULES; a helper wrapping one of them, a decode reached another way such as sys.stdin, or a module outside that list is not covered. The name set is enumerable and the set of places a decode can fail is not, which is why the names are the unit |
| Failure is injected at its source, never at the boundary under test | injecting into the boundary proves it handles what it is handed and says nothing about whether the real path delivers it. That is how an unreadable live artifact passed a test while still being reported as a changed one: scope turned the error into a refusal one layer below, and the handler never ran. Tests for these paths create the real condition |
| The identity inventory is a name set over the decision path | every read of a field declared in IDENTITY_FIELDS inside observe_state, classify_declaration and receipt_matches must pass through named() or same_identity(), and the two gated with named() are asserted as a pair. A field read outside those three functions, reached through a helper, or named something the declaration does not list is not covered. The names are enumerable and the set of places a blank could be mistaken for an identity is not, which is why the names are the unit |
