"""Settings that must survive creation and resume, and the causes that must stay apart.

Grounded in behaviour measured against a real App Server (codex-cli 0.154.0): a start carrying
config.model_reasoning_effort came back reporting that effort; sandbox came back as the full
policy object with every default filled in; all four workspace-write policy fields travelled in
the config; read-only network access travelled by no spelling at all; and a resume reported the
thread's real state rather than adopting an override.

Each test is labelled RED where it fails on the pre-change bridge, or COMPATIBILITY where it
pins behaviour that was already correct. Several are both: they assert an unchanged wire format
alongside the new settings receipt, so they fail before the change for the receipt alone.
Measured on the pre-change tree: 21 of these 22 fail, and the one that passes is the
fingerprint-replay compatibility test, which must pass on both sides.
