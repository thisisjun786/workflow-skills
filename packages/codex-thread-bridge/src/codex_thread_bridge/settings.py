"""Which execution settings are transmitted, and which the host will show us again.

Measured against a probe App Server on codex-cli 0.154.0, with the protocol bundle from
`codex app-server generate-json-schema --experimental` (schema v2) as the field reference.
Three calls carry settings and they do not carry the same ones:

    thread/start   cwd, sandbox as a MODE string, approvalPolicy, model, runtimeWorkspaceRoots,
                   environments, projectId, and a free-form config object. There is no effort
                   parameter, so reasoning effort travels as config.model_reasoning_effort or it
                   does not travel at all.
    thread/resume  the same set minus environments.
    turn/start     the full SandboxPolicy object, effort and environments, scoped to this turn
                   and the ones after it.

Observation is asymmetric, and that asymmetry decides the whole design. ThreadStartResponse and
ThreadResumeResponse report approvalPolicy, cwd, model, sandbox as the resolved policy object,
reasoningEffort, runtimeWorkspaceRoots and activePermissionProfile. TurnStartResponse defines only
`turn`. So the bridge never binds a setting through turn/start: a binding it cannot read back
could be reported as applied when it was ignored. It transmits at start or resume, reads the
answer, and withholds when the answer disagrees.

Resume is a detector, not a setter. A resume that explicitly carried sandbox "read-only" for a
workspaceWrite thread came back reporting workspaceWrite: the host accepts the parameter and
reports the thread's real state. That is precisely what verifying preservation needs, and it is
the reason a clean resume is followed by a plain turn/start with no overrides.

An echo proves recording, not honouring. A start carrying
config.model_reasoning_effort "totally-not-a-real-effort" echoed that string back as
reasoningEffort. So a matching value means the host recorded what was asked for; whether a
provider acts on that effort level is not observable here and is never claimed.

The failures are kept apart because a caller has to answer each one differently:

    setting_untransmittable   this protocol cannot carry the request at all. Decided locally,
                              before any RPC, so a local limitation is never reported as though
                              the host disagreed.
    settings_not_preserved    the host reported a different value than the one requested.
    setting_unobservable      the host reported no value, so nothing here says the setting was
                              applied or ignored. It withholds; it is never a warning attached
                              to a success.
    unsupported_approval_policy / unsupported_sandbox_type
                              the requested shape has no representation this bridge can use.

The approval policy is the one setting a caller DECLARES rather than requests. It is never
transmitted on resume, because a value this bridge does not own has no business being sent to a
thread it did not create: the declaration is a claim about the thread, and `findings` judges the
host's answer against it. Measured on codex-cli 0.154.0 in both directions, omitting the
parameter preserves the thread's own policy and does NOT inherit the CODEX_HOME config default --
a thread on on-request under a config default of never resumed as on-request, and the mirror
resumed as never. That is what makes preservation a mechanism rather than a hope, and it is why
the guard's predicate is now "the observed policy is not the declared one" instead of "the
observed policy is not never". It refuses exactly as before for a caller that declares nothing.

A raised RpcError or TransportError is the third cause named in the issue, delivery failure, and
it deliberately stays on the bridge's existing failed / outcome_unknown / not_attempted path
rather than becoming a finding: whether the request arrived at all is a different question from
what the host did with one that did.
