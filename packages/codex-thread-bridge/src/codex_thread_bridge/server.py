        an existing thread costs what a new one costs; it may also carry cwd, sandbox,
        expected_sandbox_policy, runtime_workspace_roots and approval_policy. The pair is
        authorized against this
        host's execution policy before the thread is even read, and policy_exception cites an
        operator-declared exception by id; because such an exception is bound to directories,
        expected_settings must also carry cwd whenever policy_exception is supplied, or the
        request is refused before the thread is read. The resume carries the settings and is read
        as an
        observation: this host reports a thread's real state rather than adopting an override, so
        a match confirms the thread is already in the requested state. An unrecognised key is
        rejected rather than ignored, because a discarded key is indistinguishable from a setting
        that was never requested. Any difference, or a
        setting the host does not report, withholds the message and names its own cause. The turn
        is then started with no overrides, because turn/start reports only the turn and a binding
        it cannot read back would be unverifiable. "settings" describes the resume observation,
        not the dispatched turn: no host-side exclusivity is held. Does not steer, interrupt, set
        Goals, or retry delivery. Use a stable request_id; inspect get_operation on uncertainty.

        approval_policy is DECLARED, never transmitted. It states the policy you believe the
        thread is on -- "never", "on-request" or "untrusted" -- and the resume observation is
        judged against it. The resume carries no approvalPolicy at all, so this tool cannot set
        or change the policy of a thread it did not create; measured on codex-cli 0.154.0 in both
        directions, omitting it reports the thread's own policy and does not inherit the
        CODEX_HOME config default. Omitting the key declares "never", which is what every caller
        written before this key existed meant, so an interactive thread is still refused unless
        you name its policy. A policy that is not the declared one refuses before any turn starts,
        which is how a supervisor whose state moved under you is caught rather than written to.

        Declaring an interactive policy buys delivery, not approval servicing. This bridge
        services no approval: it answers every approval request with a refusal, never grants one,
        and has NO route to the thread's own approver, because the protocol offers no way for a
        second client to hand an approval request to the client that owns the thread. So a
        supervisor that receives a report and then tries to run something is denied, and that work
        stays undone rather than becoming approved. Receiving a report and running code are
        separate capabilities and only the first is claimed; "approvals" on the receipt and
        get_capabilities both say so.

        "delivery" says what happened to the message itself, derived from what actually went out:
        not_delivered (no turn/start left this process -- the same logical message may be sent once
        more under a NEW request id), turn_started (the host took it into a turn, which is not
        completion), rejected (the host refused the turn), or outcome_unknown (a turn/start went
        out and no answer came back -- reconcile by reading the thread, never by resending).
        Supplied settings are part of the request identity, so reusing an id with different
        settings is refused, and a receipt retained before expected_settings became required is
        reconciled with get_operation rather than replayed here.
        A not_attempted receipt means no resume and no turn went out, so reusing that id sends
        the message rather than replaying a receipt.
