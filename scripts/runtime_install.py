"""Install and diagnose the runtime the workflow depends on: the bridge and the relay.

This is the separate runtime entry point OPS-2.3 asks for. scripts/install.py stays what it
is - the standard-library-only, idempotent link step for skills - and runtime installation is
never folded into it. This command reads that installer rather than reimplementing it, and it
reuses its LINKED / MISSING / CONFLICT vocabulary so one word means one thing across both.

Standard library only, and importable on the Python this repository runs its own checks with.

    """Write the claim that says this staging finished, and answer whether the RECORD landed.

    The claim settles last on purpose: it says the replacement finished, and until the selection
    and the pointer both name this environment there is nothing finished to say. That ordering
    is what makes its failure unlike every other failure in this command. Everything before it
    fails with the previous runtime still selected and still reachable -- a refusal, and the
    result says so truthfully. By the time this one can fail the selection is committed, the
    pointer is placed and read back, and the registered command resolves into this environment:
    THE REPLACEMENT HAPPENED. Only the record of it did not.

    Left to raise, that went out through the handler for failures this command does not model
    and was reported as an update failure -- false in the direction that matters. The operator
    read 'applied: false', a pointer of null, and a destination that 'cannot be retried until
    the selection moves', and none of it said the host had already moved. So this ANSWERS
    instead of raising, and the caller reports the record beside the replacement rather than in
    place of it.

    What the next run should do is part of the answer rather than left to the reader, because
    only here is it known which half is missing. A promotion that could not settle leaves the
    claim its staging wrote -- STAGING -- over a selection and a pointer that both name this
    environment, and that is exactly the state staging.decide() reads as RESUME: the next run
    finishes the bookkeeping, rebuilds nothing and removes nothing. An installation that never
    wrote a first claim leaves none at all, which the same reading answers with RECORDED for
    the same repair. Either way the destination is not stuck and the runtime is not at risk,
    which is the opposite of what the update failure said.

    OSError is the whole of what is caught, and hostrecord.Busy is an OSError: a lock this run
    could not take and a file it could not write are the same answer here. Anything else is a
    defect in this command rather than a record that would not write, and a defect reported as
    a settled-looking outcome is how one stops being found.

    AND THE RECORD HAS THE SAME SPLIT THE RESULT DOES, so it gets the same treatment rather
    than a branch. Writing the claim is two steps: the bytes are replaced under
    hostrecord.Locked, and the lock is released afterwards. A failure in the SECOND raises with
    the new bytes already on disk, and reading that as an unsettled record is this very
    substitution one layer down -- it would send an operator to repair bookkeeping that is
    already correct. So the answer carries two outcomes of its own, decided by two different
    readings:

      'settled'  -- did the RECORD land. Decided by reading the claim back, never by the
                    exception, because an exception says the call did not finish.
      'released' -- did the CALL finish. False whenever anything raised, whatever landed.

    What failed afterwards is then named as itself rather than folded into the record's
    outcome. A release that failed leaves the lock file it could not unlink, and that file is
    not cosmetic: the next claim write at this path waits on it and then refuses until it is
    gone or older than hostrecord.STALE_LOCK_SECONDS. So it is read on the filesystem, reported
    as a residual path, and carried into the recovery sentence -- the same shape _install_failed
    already reports residue in, for the same reason.

    Fail closed where the readback itself failed. A claim nobody could read establishes
    nothing, and it is not the same case as one that is merely missing: staging.decide()
    answers KEEP for an unreadable claim, so the next run refuses this directory instead of
    repairing it. The advice has to differ because the behaviour does, which is why it is
    derived from the reading rather than written once for every failure.

    """Put the pointer back the way this run found it, INCLUDING finding it absent.

    The rollback could only restore a previous target, which has no answer for a first or legacy
    install where there was no pointer at all. There, place() creates one, and a failed read-back
    left it naming a candidate the selection had just been taken away from -- and _install_failed
    then kept that candidate precisely BECAUSE the pointer named it, so the staging could never
    be reclaimed. That is the permanent refusal this command exists to remove, arriving from the
    other side, on the very path that was just made to work.

    'Restore to absence' was the value missing from this answer set, the same shape as the
    established-absent answer the in-flight cell was missing.

    'ownership' is the RECORD side of the same question, and it is the second thing this had to
    be handed. A link state of NO_POINTER says the LINK was not there; it says nothing about the
    RECORD, and a host whose recorded link was deleted out from under it has the entry and no
    link. Taking that entry away is not a rollback: it removes the path the Codex registration
    names, and a retry with a different --dest then derives another path and reads a
    registration nobody changed as a conflict. So only an entry this run INTRODUCED goes away
    with the link, and only for the path this run recorded.

    An entry this run INHERITED goes back, and what goes back depends on what the link ended up
    as, because the entry answers two questions (hostrecord.POINTER_PLACEMENT). Where the link
    was put back, the whole entry goes back -- which also takes this run's refreshed stamp off
    an entry it did not introduce. Where the link is established ABSENT, the path goes back and
    the placement evidence is WITHDRAWN: the registration still needs the path, and a link that
    turns up there afterwards is still one this command never recorded placing, which is what
    the promotion refuses. Put back whole it would authorise replacing that link, which is the
    protection the absence rollback was written to keep.

    A restoration that cannot be read back is reported as residual rather than claimed: the
    caller then keeps the candidate, which is the safe direction when the disk and the record
    may disagree.

    That applies to the RECORD half too. The link going back and the record not going with it
    is half a rollback, not a completed one: the record still says this command placed a link
    at a path where there is now none, and that claim is exactly what the next promotion reads
    before it replaces whatever has turned up there. So the restoration is not claimed as
    verified and the path whose claim somebody has to settle is named.

    non-zero. 'internalError' never becomes an UNREADABLE record, because a code defect
    filed as a data problem is a defect that disappears.
