"""What a reading of a record observed, including what it could not observe.

A record that cannot be read is an answer, not a crash. The four states below are the four
answers, and they are deliberately not interchangeable: absent means a clean host, unreadable
means something is there whose shape cannot be read, an access error means the question could
not be asked at all, and present means it was read. Collapsing any pair of them turns a
permission problem into a malformed record or a misconfigured path into a clean host.

The boundary this module provides is narrow on purpose. Only acquiring, decoding and
shape-reading a record goes inside a region. Wrapping ordinary logic would convert a genuine
defect into a refusal, which hides the defect exactly as well as a swallowed exception does,
so a refusal always carries the exception type and the source location that produced it.

    os.path.samefile stats both and compares the device and inode the kernel reports, so it

    destination, and 'link/..' lands where the link actually pointed rather than cancelling.
    It also raises when either path is not traversable, which is the half that pure string
    work cannot do.

    Four attempts reached this, and the three that failed are worth keeping written down
    because each was wrong in a way the next one reintroduced:

      - raw strings made ONE directory into two whenever the spelling differed, and an owned
        dangling pointer in the surveyed destination was disowned;
      - lexically normalised strings made TWO directories into one, because normpath cancels
        'X/..' without knowing X is a symlink;
      - requiring both forms to agree brought the first failure back for any path combining an
        alias with '..';
      - resolution alone fixed that and still collapsed 'missing/..', because realpath is
        best-effort: it equated a destination the kernel answers ENOENT for with a real one,
        so a pointer could be claimed for a destination that was never scanned.

    Every one of those was a STRING answering a question about the filesystem. This asks the
    filesystem. A failure establishes nothing and is answered "different", which keeps an
    unverified pointer out of a cleanup list -- the direction it fails in on purpose.

    Ask this only where BOTH spellings are being read together. Where one side was read
    EARLIER, ask path_identity instead: re-statting a stored spelling asks about whatever it
    names now, which is not the question the earlier reading answered.
