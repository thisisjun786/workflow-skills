"""The Stop hook adapter: the host's event in, the relay guard's answer out.

The decision this hook delivers is not made here. skills/crw-run/references/hook-contract.md
fixes the rules and codex_session_relay.guard implements them, down to the exact Stop JSON a
hook should print. What was missing was the piece between the host and that guard, and this is
it: read the payload the host delivers, ask the configured runtime, print what it answered.

Three things it will not do, each of them a way a hook turns into an outage.

It never decides a turn itself. Only a verdict the guard produced can reach stdout, so a defect
here degrades into no hook rather than into a stuck session.

It never exits 2. The host reads exit 2 as the blocking code and takes stderr as the
continuation prompt, and argparse exits 2 on any usage error, so nothing here parses arguments,
nothing here writes to stderr, and the subprocess's streams are captured rather than inherited.
A stale flag in somebody's hook file must not become a hold on every ordinary turn.

It never answers one question with another question's reading. "the guard released" and "the
guard could not be asked" are different values, and so are "the runtime refused the request" and
"the runtime rejected the call before it ran": those are different repairs, and a single
failure value would send the operator to the wrong one.

What it does not observe, it does not infer. The Stop path reads the marker and a read-only
database, so a stopped daemon is not visible from here and is never guessed at. Registration,
the runtime actually offering the subcommand, and this hook having fired are likewise three
separate questions, answered separately by status().

    thing. So equivalent spellings share a key.

    But only the transformations that PRESERVE what the kernel does. normpath() does two very
    different jobs, and the second one is not sound here:

      - dropping '.' components and duplicate separators names the same file, always;

        avoid.

    A trailing separator is left alone for the same reason: it requires a directory, so

    demand written differently and is kept for the same reason.

    Every registration in the hook file runs, so when they name different settings files they
    record into different journals; reading one of those and reporting an absence says nothing
    about the others, and reading none of them -- which is what happened -- makes a hook that
    fired into one journal indistinguishable from a hook that never fired.

    Keyed by the registration and not by the path, because the journal and the program that

    could not be attributed to the command that fills it: an unstartable registration's empty
    journal then read as evidence that its startable neighbour had recorded somewhere else.

    It writes nothing and opens only files a registration already named.

    'already_read' carries readings this call's caller has already taken, keyed by path. A
    settings file read twice in one status call is a payload that can contradict itself: the
    configuration cell reported PRESENT from the first read while namedSettings reported ABSENT
    from the second, about one file, in one answer. A reading is taken once and used wherever
    it is needed.

    Each entry answers its own records question with one of three values, never with a
    stand-in. Settings that are absent, or that this hook's own reader rejects, keep no journal
    AT ALL: run() reads them before it looks at the payload, so every invocation releases
    without writing anywhere. That is an established "nothing is kept here". A settings file
