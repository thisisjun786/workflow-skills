"""Why there is no record of this hook having fired.

The observation that a journal holds nothing has several causes and they need different
repairs: the hook may not be registered at all, it may be registered against settings this
command cannot identify, its adapter may not be startable, journalling may be switched off, or
it may be registered and recording into a journal nobody looked at. Reported as one absence,
an operator either guesses at the cause or stops there, and the operator procedure closed that
gap honestly by writing that the tool does not distinguish them. This module is that
distinction.

It takes no readings of its own. Every rule decides over cells status() has already produced,
and CAUSE_RULES declares which observation answers each cause, so a cause cannot be decided on
a reading it never names.

Two things this deliberately does NOT do. It does not stop at the first cause it establishes:
whether the host can start the adapter is not downstream of the settings, and a run that
stopped early reported a deleted settings file while saying nothing about a deleted adapter
beside it. And it never resolves an ambiguity by choosing. Where two causes both stand, the
answer says so and carries them; where a reading could not decide, the answer is unreadable and
carries what is still standing.

The one thing no answer here can establish, stated because a detector that hides its blind spot
is worse than one that has none: a journal write that fails cannot record its own failure. So
NOTHING_RECORDED is named for what was observed rather than for what it suggests. "The journal
holds nothing" and "the hook never ran" are not the same sentence, and this module only ever
says the first.
