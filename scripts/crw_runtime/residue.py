"""What a run left behind on an install destination, asked of the decision that owns it.

`residualPaths` existed only on a failed install's own JSON result, so an operator who wanted
the cleanup warning after a failed update had to have kept that run's stdout. Diagnosis is
where that question belongs, and this answers it.

It writes nothing, and it removes nothing. It does not decide either: staging.decide already
says what may be done with an environment directory that exists, and staging.REMOVES already
declares which of its decisions authorises removal. Writing a second set of rules here would be
a second opinion about the same directory kept equal to the first by hand -- and the first
draft of this module proved that is not theoretical, because its own rules had no answer for an
unreadable host record or a pointer nobody could resolve, both of which decide() has and keeps.

So an entry is residue exactly when the installer would reclaim it, and every guard that
decision carries is inherited rather than restated: a claim this command wrote, in STAGING, an
owner established gone, a selection that positively does not name it, and a protection reading
that is conservative in the safe direction. A selected staging is RESUME -- built, and possibly
in use -- and a finished environment is KEEP however its selection moved, because a process may
still be running out of it.

Two readings are excluded from the scan itself rather than judged. Symbolic links are skipped,
so the owned pointer is never followed into the environment it names and reported as a staging
sitting there; and the pointer's own path is excluded by name for the same reason.

What this answer is NOT: the install failure's residualPaths is what THAT RUN left, read from
the run itself. This is what is on the destination now. Neither is a superset of the other, and
an empty answer here never means a failed run left nothing behind.
