OPS-4.4 sequences an update around a daemon that is not running and open attempts that have been

# asks the catalog for every object it reports -- indexes, triggers and views alongside tables --
# and keys each one by its kind AND its name, so an evidence list carries "index sync_ready"
# rather than "sync_ready". The emitted key was storeTables while it already held all of that: a
# name narrower than its contents, and a reader deciding from the name alone would have taken a
# refusal about an index for one about a table.
#
# Comparing recorded schema VERSIONS would say nothing at all: the relay declares version one,
# has never raised it, writes it once with INSERT OR IGNORE when the database is created, and
# grows its schema through separate CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS statements. Every store therefore
# agrees with every candidate at version one, so a version comparison detects neither a
# downgrade nor an upgrade while looking exactly like a check. The schema is what differs.

# NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%' because LIKE reads _ as a one-character wildcard: that pattern also drops a
