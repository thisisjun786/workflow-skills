"""One destination carried from a new install to the recovery of the install it replaced.

Each landed piece already has its own tests: the integrated installer and its diagnosis, the
update that fails and restores what it found, and the completion hook the installer registers.
What none of them states is the sequence a host actually lives through -- on one destination,
with the state that has to survive it seeded before the first install and read again after the
last refusal. A suite of separately passing installer tests is not that sequence, and the
difference is where a host loses a runtime.

So this module composes rather than repeats. It drives the fixture the update tests already
drive through four stages against one temporary destination, one host record, one Codex
configuration, one hook file and one store, and it asserts on what survived rather than on what
a command reported about itself.

Three rules are the point of the composition rather than decoration.

A cell is filled by the reading its own question called for. READINGS declares the cell, the
source that answers it and the path the answer is read from, and read() is the only way a cell
is ever filled. A reading that could not be made reads UNREADABLE: it never reads False, and it
never borrows the value of the cell beside it. crw_runtime/check.py states the same rule for the
eight result fields -- "None of the eight is ever derived from another" -- and this is where the
rule is exercised across three sources instead of inside one payload.

An assertion about survival is worthless unless something happened. Every stage therefore also
asserts what a run that did nothing could not produce: an environment the command built, a
selection naming it, a pointer reaching it, and a named seam that actually fired.

Nothing here is evidence about a host. Every path is a temporary directory, the two build steps
and the relay are stand-ins inherited from the update fixture, the diagnosis runs with HOME,
XDG_STATE_HOME, CODEX_HOME and PATH pointed inside that directory, and PROVENANCE records that a
row filled here is a fixture answer. What a real combination would have to record, and the
procedure for running one, is in docs/runtime-install.md.

A fourth rule arrived as three separate findings and is one rule. A row can reach its success
answer, down the path it declared, on the host it declared, and still be answering about
something this scenario never built: a helper called instead of the registered command, a second
Codex home, a run told its store was absent while the fixture had populated one. What those share
is that something handed to the thing under test was not what the scenario built, and the
difference was nowhere in the claim. So HANDED declares, per function, whether what it hands is
the built value or a stand-in -- and a stand-in says what the scenario has instead and what a row
reading through it therefore does not prove. INJECTIONS does the same for the switches the update
fixture accepts, and names the one this module must not hand.
