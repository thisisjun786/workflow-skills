"""One destination carried from a new install to the recovery of the install it replaced.

Each landed piece already has its own tests: the integrated installer and its diagnosis, the
update that fails and restores what it found, and the completion hook the installer registers.
What none of them states is the sequence a host actually lives through -- on one destination,
with the state that has to survive it seeded before the first install and read again after the
last refusal. A suite of separately passing installer tests is not that sequence, and the
difference is where a host loses a runtime.

So this module composes rather than repeats. It drives the fixture the update tests already
drive through four stages against one temporary destination, one host record, one Codex
configuration, one hook file and one store, and it asserts on what survived rather than on what
a command reported about itself.

Three rules are the point of the composition rather than decoration.

A cell is filled by the reading its own question called for. READINGS declares the cell, the
source that answers it and the path the answer is read from, and read() is the only way a cell
is ever filled. A reading that could not be made reads UNREADABLE: it never reads False, and it
never borrows the value of the cell beside it. crw_runtime/check.py states the same rule for the
eight result fields -- "None of the eight is ever derived from another" -- and this is where the
rule is exercised across three sources instead of inside one payload.

An assertion about survival is worthless unless something happened. Every stage therefore also
asserts what a run that did nothing could not produce: an environment the command built, a
selection naming it, a pointer reaching it, and a named seam that actually fired.

Nothing here is evidence about a host. Every path is a temporary directory, the two build steps
and the relay are stand-ins inherited from the update fixture, the diagnosis runs with HOME,
XDG_STATE_HOME, CODEX_HOME and PATH pointed inside that directory, and PROVENANCE records that a
row filled here is a fixture answer. What a real combination would have to record, and the
procedure for running one, is in docs/runtime-install.md.

A fourth rule arrived as three separate findings and is one rule. A row can reach its success
answer, down the path it declared, on the host it declared, and still be answering about
something this scenario never built: a helper called instead of the registered command, a second
Codex home, a run told its store was absent while the fixture had populated one. What those share
is that something handed to the thing under test was not what the scenario built, and the
difference was nowhere in the claim. So HANDED declares, per function, whether what it hands is
the built value or a stand-in -- and a stand-in says what the scenario has instead and what a row
reading through it therefore does not prove. INJECTIONS does the same for the switches the update
fixture accepts, and names the one this module must not hand.

# Every place the certainty of a class-body binding is decided. A name bound under a branch that
# may not run does not shadow -- whether it ran is a question about the run -- and treating one
# as definite loses the place that really does reach the enclosing name. That direction is a
# MISS: the inventory then accepts a place nobody declared, which is the ground this module
# exists to hold. So each binding yielded in bound_in has to ASK, and one that does not is
# declared here with the reason it may. Derived from bound_in's own text and keyed by the node
# kinds its branch tests, so a new unguarded branch fails here instead of arriving as a finding.
# Every place that decides WHICH binding a name refers to, derived from this file's own text.
#
# EXTRACTION PREDICATE, written down because a derived list is only as complete as its
# predicate, and treating "it is derived" as completeness is this module's own defect one level
# up. A site is recognised when it calls _bound_around -- which asks WHETHER some enclosing
# scope binds the name -- or _nearest, which asks HOW NEAR the nearest binding is. Those two
# are the only helpers through which this reader consults a scope-keyed binding map by name.
#
# OBSERVABLE BOUNDARIES, as data rather than as a sentence. Recognising calls to two names and
# nothing else, the predicate does NOT see a site that walks the scope chain inline, one that
# reads a scope-keyed map directly the way _visible_from does, or one written in another
# module. The control below plants the second of those and requires it to be absent, so the
# boundary is a measured fact rather than a caveat.
#
# A fourth shape, added because review found it after this inventory was built and the first
# three did not cover it. The predicate recognises a site that CONSULTS a scope-keyed map; it
# is blind to one that BUILDS its own map keyed by a bare name, because such a site never
# consults anything and so never calls either helper. _default_applies was exactly that, and
# this inventory would not have caught it. The control below requires that blindness to stay
# true, so it is a known gap rather than a surprise -- but a known gap is what it is, and the
# next site of that shape will reach a reviewer before it reaches this list.
#
# A fifth, and it is the sharpest so far because the sites in question were ALREADY RECOGNISED.
# This sweep asks WHETHER a site measures distance. It cannot ask WHICH OWNER SHAPES it
# measures it for. _source_spelled and _refusal_spelled both call _nearest and both appeared
# clean here while measuring distance only for a bare ast.Name owner -- so a parameter taking
# the root of a qualified owner, io in io.open or crw_runtime in crw_runtime.reading.UNREADABLE,
# walked past a site this list called covered. A name in the recognised set therefore says the
# question is asked somewhere in that function and nothing about the shapes it is asked for.
# There is no control for this one: which owner shapes a site covers is not readable from the
# fact that it calls _nearest, and inventing a predicate that claimed to read it would be the
# same fallacy again. It is written down instead.
#
# A sixth thing this list does not cover at all, said so it is not mistaken for silence:
# execution position. Whether a binding exists YET relative to a statement is a different axis
# from which scope owns a name, and _opens_here decides it alone.
#
# COVERAGE IS NOT CORRECTNESS. This says every site asks the question; the paired cases in
# RESOLVES_LIKE_PYTHON say the answers match Python. Neither claim substitutes for the other.

# What the two derived lists below can actually see, derived rather than remembered.
#
# Both checks used to recognise FORMS: one shape of ast.parse call, and three spellings of a
# refusal inside a call whose name begins with assert. A form nobody had thought of was a silent
# pass, and one of the three spellings was a hardcoded set of constant names -- the enumerated
# literal standing in for a derivation that this repository's evidence rule refuses. Four times
# now a derivation in this project has reached less far than the sentence describing it, and each
# time the argument for the sentence was that the set was derived. A derivation is only as
# complete as its predicate.
#
# So the rule here is the negative one. Derive every spelling of the declared thing by asking the
# objects, account for EVERY occurrence of one, and fail on an occurrence nobody wrote down. A
# form nobody anticipated is still an occurrence, so it arrives as a failure rather than as
# another review round. What the derivation still cannot reach is not argued away in a sentence:
# it is returned as data, declared, and each declared form carries a control that plants it and
# requires the derivation not to see it.
#
# Where the reader cannot tell, it errs in one direction on purpose. It follows names -- a handle,
# a called name, a name bound to one, an attribute a class binds -- and it does NOT follow flow.
# So a name that ever holds the thing is treated as holding it for that scope, even where a later
# line rebinds it. That is wrong in the direction where somebody has to write a sentence rather
# than in the direction where a place settles for a refusal unasked. Being precise about which
# binding a particular line saw would mean following flow, and a precise-looking answer this
# reader cannot actually justify is the thing this whole module exists to refuse.
#
# That is the direction it prefers where it can see at all, and it is not a claim of
# completeness. The forms it cannot see are the ones in SOURCE_OUT_OF_REACH and
# REFUSAL_OUT_OF_REACH: a name spelled as a string, a callable taken out of a registry, a helper
# in another module. A place arriving in one of those settles for a refusal and is never asked
# about, which is the cost of following names, and the reason those are written down as data with
# a control each rather than argued away here.
#
# Where a name IS in the text, agreeing with Python is not optional, and this reader resolves
# through classes while Python resolves through objects. Every measured disagreement between the
# two is in RESOLVES_LIKE_PYTHON with the sample that produces it and the answer Python gives.
#
# A class is keyed by the scope it is written in as well as its spelling, so two classes of one
# name in different functions are two classes to every table at once: the method index, the
# held-attribute table, the property index and the base list. This was recorded here as a limit
# for a long while, on the grounds that telling them apart would mean carrying the enclosing
# chain through all of those together. It would, and that is what it now does -- a limit of cost
# is not a limit of reach, and only what the reader genuinely cannot see belongs in a record of
# what it cannot see.
#
# Place names are the other question and still leave classes out of the chain, so two methods of
# one name in one function collide on purpose and the pin below fails rather than letting one
# declaration speak for both. That is what keeps every declaration from rotting: widening
# the derivation later makes the control for the form it now covers fail, which is the prompt to
# delete the entry rather than leave a limitation standing that stopped being true.

        Three times a check in this module concluded something about behaviour by reading source
        text, and each time the repair was the instance. The instances share a shape: a claim
        about what code does, settled by how the code is spelled -- and where the file being read
        is the file making the claim, the check can be satisfied by its own declaration.
        AGENTS.md states the rule for this repository: a text-matching test is not proof of
        behaviour.

        What this check used to see was one form, a call to ast.parse inside a function, and it
        said so. Anything else -- read_text compared directly, a phrase searched for, a name
        imported from ast, a helper handing the text on -- was simply not looked at, so the
        sentence above it reached further than the check did. It now derives instead: every
        binding of this module that is a path to a .py file that exists, the __file__ every
        module carries, every called name that hands source back (asked of the callable, which
        is where ast.parse comes from, so the one form that used to be spelled out by hand is
        now read off ast.parse's own signature), and every string naming a .py file. Then it
        accounts for EVERY occurrence of one, attributed to the innermost function it sits in and
        named by the chain around it, so a nested helper or a lambda inside an already declared
        place is its own place rather than something that place absorbs. A place that reaches
        source text some way nobody anticipated is still an occurrence of a handle, so it arrives
        here as a failure.

        This claims exactly that much. A name this derivation could not read is in
        SOURCE_UNDECIDED_CALLS rather than assumed harmless, and the forms it cannot reach at all

        """The inventory of accepted answers, derived by accounting for every occurrence.

        What this used to see was a refusal spelled as a literal, or as one of five constant
        names written into the check itself, inside a call whose name began with assert. Three
        forms, enumerated by hand -- and the enumerated half is the part that cannot grow: a
        constant added to REFUSAL_ANSWERS was invisible until somebody remembered to add its
        name here too, and a refusal bound to a name before the assertion, or required through
        assertIn against the answers themselves, was never looked at at all.

        So nothing in the spelling table is written down now. refusal_spellings asks the objects: the answers are
        REFUSAL_ANSWERS, and every way one can be written is derived from them -- an attribute an
        imported module binds to one, a global here bound to one, a collection here or on an
        imported module that contains one, and an attribute a class binds one to for its own
        methods to read. Then EVERY occurrence of any of those is accounted for: it belongs to a
        place that settles for a refusal, or to one that names a refusal without settling, or the
        module fails naming the place, the line and the spelling. The place is the innermost
        function the occurrence sits in, named by the chain around it, so a nested helper or a
        lambda inside an already declared method is its own place rather than something the
        declaration absorbs. A helper that hands a refusal BACK rather than returning a container
        holding one carries its callers in with it, through a bare call or through self.

        The point is not that refusals are forbidden -- this repository is built on absence being
        a real answer. It is that a place settling for one has to say why the refusal is the
        right answer to the question it asks, so that no acceptance row quietly accepts its own
        failure. What is still out of reach is in REFUSAL_OUT_OF_REACH with a control for each.
