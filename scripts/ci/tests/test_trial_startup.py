"""What the live-trial preflight has to be true of, asserted against runs rather than declarations.

The module under test reports that every reading was met. That is the sentence most worth
distrusting, because the arrangement has a silent failure that produces it: hand it payloads that
carry none of the fields its predicates read and every cell answers unknown, which is not a pass but
is also not a crash. So this module asserts the states themselves, and it writes the inventories out
here rather than importing the module's own declarations. A checker that quietly changed what it
expected would otherwise change this check with it.

Nothing here needs a host. The relay is a stub launcher this test writes, the host record is one it
writes beside it, the git repositories are real but empty, and the supervisor is a real background
process this test starts and stops. The one thing it does not stub is the field names: the payload
contract test parses the relay's own source and asserts that every field name the module reads is
still there, so a stub that invented a field cannot make this suite pass.

The trial root has to sit outside every git worktree, because that is what the module refuses. On a
host whose temporary directory is itself a checkout, set CRW_TRIAL_TMPDIR to a clean path.
