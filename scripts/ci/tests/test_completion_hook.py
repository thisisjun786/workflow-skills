"""The completion hook adapter, exercised against a fake relay in temporary destinations.

Nothing here reads or changes a real Codex home, an installed runtime, an MCP registration or
an operational database. The relay is a script this file writes, so no case depends on what
happens to be installed on the machine running it, and a host whose relay predates the guard is
one of the cases rather than an obstacle to running them.

What these establish: that the adapter calls the guard the way the contract fixes, that it
cannot cost a turn when anything goes wrong, and that the answers it gives about its own
failures stay distinct from each other and from the guard's. What they do not establish: that a
real Codex host invoked it, honoured its output, or delivered a hold. That is the separate
evidence the hook contract's packet and this repository's status command keep apart.
