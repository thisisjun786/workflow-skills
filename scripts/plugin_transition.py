"""Move a manual CRW installation to the plugin installation, and own what follows it.

Five commands, one JSON document each, so a run leaves a receipt that can be diffed:

    inspect     read-only: both installs, the owner of each surface, in-flight work
    transition  manual -> plugin, in order, --apply to act and a dry run otherwise
    disable     stop new calls without deleting anything
    remove      delete the records this repository wrote, and only those
    swap-state  what a version replacement left, actual state reported apart from recorded

What none of them do: install a runtime, register a plugin, grant hook trust, stop a service, or
delete an operational database, journal, receipt or assignment. Written, registered, trusted and
fired are four claims, and this tool can establish the first two at most.

Standard library only, and it never calls the runtime installer's install, hook or register-mcp
commands: it reads that package's readers and writers directly, so the diagnosis those commands
own keeps answering about a host this tool did not reshape underneath it.
