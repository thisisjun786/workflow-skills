"""What is confirmed before a live trial starts, and what its interventions cost.

A live trial drives the installed runtime through a real completion, delivery, verdict and
correction round trip. Three recorded failures of one were all preparation: a supervisor that did
not survive the shell that launched it, participants created without a turn whose lifecycle no read
could resolve, and an assignment file read before the new relationship id was in it. This module
takes the readings that catch those, refuses a dispatch whose identity disagrees with the store, and
grades the trial's own intervention ledger. The procedure it serves is docs/live-trial.md.

Four rules are the whole of it.

It reads. It does not create a task, register a relationship, emit, deliver, record a verdict, or
start or stop anything. The only programs it starts are git and the relay entry point that the
runtime host record names through its owned pointer, and it composes every command line itself from
parameters: the start record carries no argv, so no record can nominate another program. That is
not a claim that nothing is written, because every relay command opens the store on construction;
it is the claim that nothing it runs registers, emits, delivers, records a verdict or changes
service state, that doctor runs before anything that can construct a store, and that a store which
did not exist before this process started is a refusal rather than a pass.

A cell is answered when the payload carries the field its predicate reads. Otherwise it is unknown,
whatever the exit status was, and the exit status is recorded beside the cell rather than
substituted for the reading. doctor exits non-zero while printing its whole diagnosis when it
cannot prove a shared store, so a cell reading the status would call a real answer unreadable and a
cell ignoring the payload would call a refusal a pass.

Four readings are taken here and two are graded. No read-only relay command performs a lifecycle
read and none returns what a creation receipt echoed, so those two arrive as captures, carry the
time they were taken, and are labelled as the caller's claim about a read this process did not
make.

A judgment is any field named passed or met, collected by walking the document that was assembled
rather than from a list of the kinds that produce them. The exit status comes from that walk and
from nothing else.
